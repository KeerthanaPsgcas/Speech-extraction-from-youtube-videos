Every doctor writes in his own way as the name and treatment methods of the disease, it becomes very difficult for another doctor to understand many times for decades.A solution has also been found for this ongoing problem, I am happy to tell that the Ministry of Ayush has classified data and terminology related to Ayurveda and Unani medicine, in which the World Health Organization has also helped both efforts.From Ayurveda U The vocabulary of the disease and treatment in the grandmother and perfect therapy has been coded, now all doctors will write the same language on the prescription or their slip, one of the advantages will be that if you go to another doctor with that slip thenThe doctor will get complete information about this from that slip itself.Those who are associated with research work Scientists will also get complete information about disease medicines and its effect, by increasing research and joining many scientists, this medical method will give and better results and people will increase their inclination towards them.My colleagues will adopt coding as soon as possible, when I am talking about Ayush medical system, then a picture of Jamo people is also coming in front of my eyes.

Hai my dear countrymen, our relationship has become a decade, it has become a decade old. Even in this era of social media and internet, radio is a strong medium to connect the whole country.A unique example of this is being seen in Chhattisgarh, a popular program has been broadcast on the radio here for the last seven years, which is called Hamar Hathi Hamar Got, you may feel that what can be the connection of radio and elephant.But this is the quality of radio This program is broadcast every evening from Ambikapur Raipur Bilaspur and Raigad, four centers of All India Radio in Chhattisgarh, and you will be surprised to know that we listen to this program with great care in the forest of Chhattisgarh and its surrounding area.It is said in the program that the information of elephants passing through which area of the jungle is very useful for the people here, as soon as people get information about the flock of elephants from the radio, they become careful through which the paths through which the paths thatElephant Gujrat The danger of going there is averted, while the possibility of damage due to the passion of another elephants is decreasing, while the use of this data will help in the preservation of elephants in the future.

Always remember that one of your vote can change the fate of the country.

The name of the school is Karthik Urao Adivasi Kudukh School School. 300 tribal children study Kudukh language Urao is the mother tongue of the tribal community. Kudukh language also has its own script.This language, which is known as Tol Sei, was gradually becoming extinct, to save, this community has decided to teach children in its language, Arvind Urao, who started the school, says that tribal children get EnglishThere was a problem in the language That is why he started teaching the children of the village in his mother tongue. Their efforts started getting better results, then the villagers also joined them, due to their language, the pace of learning of children has also intensified in our countryMany children used to leave studies due to the difficulties of language, it is also helping with the new National Education Policy to remove such problems, it is our endeavor that language should not be a hindrance in the education and progress of any child.Give India land in every period The unique daughters of Sh have filled with pride, Savitribai Phule ji and Rani Belu Nachiyar ji.

7mjvqLfckWM,PM Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat LIVE: 107th Episode with the Nation,https://youtube.com/watch?v=7mjvqLfckWM,2023-11-25,"Welcome to my dear countrymen Namaskar Mann Ki Baat, but today we can never forget 26 NovemberThe ability is that we are upset with that attack and now they are also crushing terror with full encouragement, I pay tribute to all the people who have lost our lives in the Mumbai attack.My family members are one day of 26 November And because of this, it is also very important, on this day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India.It should be celebrated as Constitution Day and since then every year we have been celebrating this day as Constitution Day, I wish all the countrymen a very happy Constitution Day and we all togetherGiving priority, definitely fulfill the resolution of India Friends, we all know that it took two years 11 months 18 days to build the Constitution, Shri Sachchidanand Sinha was the eldest member of the Constituent Assembly. The draft of our Constitution was prepared after studying and long discussion of the Constitution of more than 60 countries.It was done that after the draft was prepared, more than 2000 amendments were made in it before finalizing it, even after the constitution came into force in 1950, a total of 106 times have been amended a total of 106 times.-The governments separated -Amendments were made at the time, but it was also unfortunate that the first amendment of the Constitution was to cut the rights of Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Expression, while the mistakes made during the Emergency were rectified through 44 and amendment of the Constitution.The colleagues were also very inspiring that some members of the Constituent Assembly were nominated, out of which 15 women were such members Hansa Mehta ji had raised the voice of women's rights and justice. At that time India was in some countries where women were in women.Right to voting from constitution When everyone is supported in the creation of the nation, only then everyone is able to develop, I am satisfied that the Parliament of India has now passed the Nari Shakti Vandan Act, following the same distant vision of the constitution makers.The example of determination power is the example of this developed India will be equally helpful to give momentum to our resolve, when the people take over the command of nation building, then no power in the world is able to stop that country from moving forward today.Clear in India too It is being seen that many changes are being led by 140 crore people of the country, a direct example of this, we have seen in this time of festivals, last month I had insisted on buying Vocal for Local i.e. local products.Within days, Diwali Bhaiya Dooj and Chhat have a turnover of more than 4 lakh crores in the country and during this time the tremendous enthusiasm of buying products made in India was seen in the people, now even the children of the household also see it while buying something at the shop.Looks like Made in India is written in it Whether or not it is written, not only this, while buying online goods, people do not forget to see it even, like the success of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the success of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is becoming his inspiration, in the same way, the success of Wocal for Local is opening the doors of rich India, developed India.This campaign of Wocal for Local strengthens the economy of the entire country. Wocal for local campaign is a guarantee of employment. It is a guarantee of development. It is a guarantee of balanced development of the country. This provides equal opportunities for both urban and rural.Value The path of edition is also created and if ever there is ups and downs in the global economy, then the mantra of Vocal for Local also preserves our economy, this feeling towards Indian products should not be limited to festivals only.It has been said that some business organizations estimate that in this season of weddings, a turnover of about 5 lakh crores can be done in the purchase related to weddings, you should give importance to all the products made in India and yes when it comes to marriage, oneTalk to me long For a long time, sometimes it hurts a lot and if I do not ask my family's pain to my family, then whom will you tell you, think these days, which is becoming a new atmosphere in some families who go abroad and get married abroad.Is it necessary, is it necessary, if we celebrate marriage among the people of India in the soil of India, then the money of the country will be in the country, the people of the country will get the opportunity to do some service in your wedding, even small poor people will also get their childrenWill you tell about your marriage, do you mission of Vocal for Local We can expand why we marry such ceremonies in our own country, you may not have the same arrangement today, but if we will organize this type of events, then the arrangements will also develop, it is a matter related to very big families.I hope my pain will definitely reach those big families, my family members have seen another big trend in this season, this is the second consecutive year when the trend of buying some goods by giving cash on the occasion of Deepawali graduallyGetting less That is, now people are making more and more digital payments, it is also going to be very enthusiastic, you can do one more work, you can decide that for a month, you will pay from UPI or any digital medium, you will not pay cash, digital will not be done in India.The success of revolution has made it absolutely possible and when it takes a month, you will definitely share your experience your photo, I give you their best wishes in advance. My family members gave you another great news to the country.Which is to fill all of us with pride Intelligence idea and innovation is the identity of Indian youth today, in this, technology compensation should increase their intellectual properties continuously, it is important progress in itself, it is important to know that you will feel good to know that Indians will be patented in 222.The application has increased by more than 31 Q.

Today, our school children are also promoting the spirit of innovation in Atal Tinkering Lab Atal Innovation Mission Colleges Incubation Centers India Campaign Startups India Campaign Results of such continuous effortsIt is also in front of India's youth power is a direct example of India's innovative power, we will also show the resolve of developed India while moving forward with this passion and that is why I say again and again, I say again and again Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Y Vigyan Jai Research My dear countrymen, you will remember that some time ago I had discussed a large number of fairs in Mann Ki Baat, then the idea of a competition also came in which people should share photos related to fairs, Culture MinistryRegarding this, you would like to know that thousands of people took part in it and many people also won the award, Rajesh Dhar ji, who lives in Kolkata, also won the award.For This fair won the award. Anupam Singh ji received the fair portrait award for showcasing Holi of Varanasi, Arun Kumar Nari Mela Ji Kulsai was rewarded for showing an attractive aspect related to Kulsai Dasra, in the same way.The photo showing devotion was included in the most liked photo, which was sent by Mr. Rahul ji, a gentleman from Maharashtra, in this competition, many photos were also of local dishes during the fairs, in which the residents of Purlia came to Purlia.

Your local festival or product can make them global by doing so, friends, like the fairs in the village, we have its own legacy of various dances here.There is a very famous dance in tribal areas, which is called by the name of Chhau, from November 15 to 17, Chhau festival was organized in Srinagar with the spirit of an Bharat Shrestha Bharat. In this program, everyone enjoyed the Chhau dance to the youth of SrinagarDance train A workshop was also organized to give Aing.It was also felt in Saudi Arabia, this month, an event called Sanskrit Utsav in Saudi Arabia was very unique because this whole program was in Sanskrit dialogue music dance everything in Sanskrit, the participation of the local people in it in Sanskrit. My family members, clean India, has now become the favorite subject of the whole country, my dear subject is there and as soon as I get any news related to it, my mind goes on that side and is naturalThere is a place in the matter that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has changed the thinking of people on cleanliness and public hygiene. This initiative has become a symbol of national spirit today, which has improved the lives of crores of countrymen, this campaign has different areas.For collective participation to the people especially the youth It has also inspired one such commendable effort has been seen in Surat. A team of youth has started Project Surat here. It aims to make Surat a model city which became the best example of cleanliness and sustainable development.As part of this effort started from Surat, the youth of Surat used to clean up the public place and Dumas Beach, later these people got involved in cleaning the banks of the Tapi river and you will be happy to know that the people associated with it will be happy to knowNumber 5 has exceeded Haj The support of the team increased the confidence of the team, after which they also started the work of collecting garbage, you will be surprised to know that this team has removed millions of kg of garbageAnd information has come, a few weeks ago, there was a Bhadvi Pam Fair in Ambaji, more than 50 lakh people came to this fair, this fair is every year, the special thing is that the people who came to the fair have a big big gabbar hill.Temple carried out cleanliness campaign in part This campaign to keep the entire area clean around the vicinity is very inspiring. Friends, I always say that cleanliness is not a day or a week campaign, but it is a task in life, we also see people around them whoNathan ji, who lives in Kontur, Tamil Nadu, put his whole life on the subjects related to cleanliness. He was often upset by seeing the torn clothes of poor children in childhood, after which he pledged to help such children and hisA part of the earnings Started donating them, when there was a shortage of money, Loganathan cleaned to the toilet so that they could help the needy children, they have been engaged in this work with a completely dedication of the last 25 years and till now more than 1500 children.Has helped, I appreciate such efforts once again, many such efforts happening across the country not only inspire us, but also arouses the will power to pass something new, my family members have very big challenges of the 21st century.One of the water security water is conservation There is no less than saving life, when we do any work with this spirit of collective, then there is an example of this, there is also Amrit Sarovar being built in every district of the country.They have been made, they will give benefits to the coming generations, now it is also our responsibility that wherever Amrit Sarovars have been made, they are constant care, they remain the main source of water conservation, amidst similar discussions of water conservation, I was in Amreli, Gujarat, amidst similar discussions.Water festival also revealed 12 months flowing in Gujarat There is also a lack of rivers, so people have to depend on most of the rain water, after the efforts of the government and social organizations in the last 20-2 years, there has been a change in the situation there and hence there is a big role of water festival there.During the water festival in Amreli, awareness was increased among the people about water conservation and conservation of people. In this, water spots were also promoted along with the experts of the watter security, the people involved in the program were liked by the tricolor water fountains.Of this water festival The event was organized by the vegetable brother who earned a name in the diamond business of Surat, I congratulated everyone involved in this, I wish that my family members wish for the same work for water conservation. My family members today todayAcceptance is getting when we teach someone a skill, then not only give it a skill but also give it a source of income and when I came to know that an institution has been engaged in skill development work for the last four decades, then I am moreNice this institution and Andhra It is in Srikakulam in the state and its name is Belji Puram Youth Club, by focusing on skill development, Belji Puram Youth Club has strengthened about 7000 women, most of these women are doing some work on their own today, this institution has done child laborBelji Puram Youth Club's team has also helped the children who have taught them some skills to get them out of the vicious cycle.Even about this youth Lab is spreading awareness in every village, it has also helped to construct many toilets. I congratulate all the people associated with this institution for skill development.For similar collective efforts, the colleagues are required, when the collective efforts are made for a one goal, then the height of success also becomes more, I want to share an inspiring example of Ladakh with all of you, you must definitely do about Pashmina ShawlYou must have heard for some time Dakhi Pashmina is also being discussed a lot in the name of Ladakhi Pashmina Looms of Ladakh, you will be surprised to know that more than 450 women from 15 villages are involved in preparing it.Only the tourists visiting there were disobeyed, but now in this era of digital India, the things made by them are starting to reach different markets of the country, that is, our local is now getting global and this is also getting bigger than these women, women powerSuch successes in every corner of the country The need is to bring such things as much as possible and what will be better than the mind to tell me, then you should also share such examples with me as much as possible, I will also try my best to bring them among youIn my family members Man Ki Baat, we have been discussing such collective efforts that have brought major changes in the society, another achievement of the mind is that it has made radio more popular in the house.On the village, I am a Ram Singh Buddhist of Amroha in Uttar Pradesh A letter has been received, Ram Singh ji has been engaged in the work of collecting radio for the last several decades, he says that since Mann Ki Baat, the eagerness of the people towards his radio museum has increased and the same is inspired by the mind, Ahmedabad is inspired by Ahmedabad.Near Tirtha Dham Prerna Tirtha has set up an interesting exhibition. In this, more than 100 antic radio has been kept from the country and abroad, here all the episodes of the mind can be heard so far, there are many more examples that show how people show how peopleInspired by Mann Ki Baat, he started his own work One such example belongs to Varsha ji of Chamraj Nagar, Karnataka, which Mann Ki Baat inspired to stand on its feet, inspired by an episode of this program, he started making organic manure from bananas and started making a lot of love with nature.This initiative of Varsha ji, who has kept, has also brought employment opportunities for other people, my family members tomorrow is the festival of Kartik Purnima on November 27I must see this time I can not go to Kashi I am getting, but through Mann Ki Baat, I am sending my best wishes to the people of Banaras, this time also millions will be burnt on the ghats of Kashi, a grand aarti will be laser show will be a laser show, millions of people from abroad people from abroadFriends will enjoy Guru Nanak Dev Ji on the full moon day, it is also the light festival of Guru Nanak ji, the precious message of Guru Nanak is still inspiring and relevant for the world even today, it inspires us to be simple harmony and dedication to others.Guru Nanak Dev Ji has served service Our Sikh siblings are seen following the tasks that have been learned about the work, I wish all the listeners of the mind, and wish the light festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Seeing this with me, 2023 was moving towards the end and like every time we are also thinking that hey years has passed so soon, but it is also true that this year has been a year of immense achievements for India andIndia's achievements are the achievements of every Indian, I am happy that Indian thing is Indian A powerful meaning of bringing out such achievements of this has become a strong meaning next time you will talk to you again on the many successes of the countrymen, till then I will give me a lot of wealth"

My dear countrymen Namaskar I got all the letters of all of you, social media and also send many messages on the Namo app that I am very heavy for you, in this program we are very heavy for itEveryone's effort is that in discussing each other's system efforts, there is a decrease of change from the mass movement and has told the whole country. In this episode, I want to discuss a mass movement of the country today, whose every citizen of the countryThere is a lot of importance in life but before that today's generation The youth want to ask the youth a question to the youth of 24 25 years and the question is very serious that now I must think that your parents know that when your parents were of your age, then once they were of your ageIt was taken away, now you must be wondering how this can happen is impossible, but my young colleagues had once happened in our country. It was a matter of 1975 years ago that it was the time of June when the emergency was imposed.Emergency was implemented, all the rights were taken away from the citizens of the country. A right from the Constitution's Article Twenty One had Right to Life and Personal Liberty, at that time, it was attempted to crush India's democracy that there was a wretch and control censorship on the constitutional body was that without acceptance, nothing was hidden without acceptance.If the famous singer Kishore Kumar has refused to take action of the government, then his entry has been removed from the radio on the radio, but there is a lot of effort to India even after thousands of arrests and torture of millions of peoplePeople of people In the system, it does not believe that the democratic spirit of democracy that have been coming out in our people of India for centuries, in our rag, the people of India won the emergency in a democratic way and removing the emergency in a democratic manner.It is difficult to find such an example of defeating the dictatorial growth tendency of the dictatorship of the establishment in a democratic way, with the support of the support of the countrymen being a partner of the struggle of the struggle, I had the privilege of being a partner of being a partner of the struggle that democracy went to a democracy. As Nick and today when the country is celebrating the first year of its independence, you are celebrating Amrit Mahotsav, then we should never forget that horrific phase of emergency, even generations to come should not speak Amrit Mahotsav hundreds of yearsNot only the victory of liberation from slavery, but it is possible to travel 75 years after today that by learning from every important stage of history, the Deputy Chairman grows.Do not imagine that everyone in childhood The moon stars of the sky attract their stories. Akash is synonymous with the spirit of the youth to realize that when our India is touching the sky of success in so many areas, then how can Akash disciple space remain untouched by spaceIn the past, many big people associated with the space sector in our country have become one of these achievements in the country, an agency in the construction of these space agency which is promoting new opportunities for the private sector of India in the space center.Is that in this beginning our I have specially attracted the youth of the country that I will be many youths, I got the message related to it, a few days ago, when I went to the inauguration of this tomato in it, I interacted with the enthusiasm of many stars for a long time andIf you know about it, you will be surprised as the number and speed of stars was not known about the startup in the space center in our country till a few years ago that today their number is more than 100, all these startups on such ideasWorking about first or So it is not thought that it is considered impossible for the private sector. For example, two startups from Chennai and Hyderabad are developing the launch from the Agnicone subscribe staff which will take small cylinders in space, this is expected to reduce the price of stress launching, it is expected to be very low.Similarly, another startup through Hyderabad, Through Space Satellite Dipl A and Technology for satellite were met by non -subscribe Tanveer Ahmed working on the solar panel who are trying to destroy the waste of space, so I also gave them a challenge It is that he should work by doing such technology, which can be solved clicking, both and men are going to launch their first from ISRO's launch on June 30, similarFriend entry is making which do not wash but will also be very less that the demand of this technology can be done all over the world. In the program of these space, Mehsana was also met by the school student daughter Tanveer Patel, she also worked on a very small satellite nextTake space in a few months It is going to happen that the lack of told me about his work very easily in Gujarati, he will give it like Tanveer, he is working on 75 such satellites at subscribe Amrit Mahotsav and it is also a matter of happiness that most of these most of theseStudents from small cities of the country, their colleagues, this is the same youth who used to have a secret mission of the sector a few years ago, but he did space research and now the youth of the country who are launching their satellite are ready to touch the sky.Then how can our country be left behind Hearing the mind of the countrymen, Ravana will be the police and you will get inspiration that in the past, our Olympic gold medal winner Neeraj Chopra is again setting in the headlines, even after the Olympics, he is setting new records of success one after the other and in the fieldNeeraj won the silver in the Pavana Games, not only that he also broke the record of his own javelin throw. In these games, Neeraj once again won the gold by winning gold, this Gowda won in such cases, the weather there was very bad, this decision was very bad.Today's identity In the Khelo India Youth Games of the accused, who are making new records from the top to the sports world, our players have liked to know you, not only that 11 record officers have recorded the names of women players that the amount of Manipur was recorded by Reena DeviThat made eight records in weightlifting, similarly Sanjana Sonakshi and Bhavna have also made different records.

He also saw Shastri's passbook and also saw how much he hadLess savings were meaning A Gi has written that Unhen did not even know that before joining the freedom struggle like Morarji, he had a long length in the administrative service in Gujarat, he wrote about Sarthak Chaudhary Charan Singh ji that Unhen addressesIt was not that Chaudhary Charan Singh ji had a huge contribution in the field of zamindari eradication, not only this, when I saw about the land reform, I saw that Mr. B Narasimha Rao ji takes a lot of interest in the low of land reforms.Sarthak ji too It was revealed that Chandrashekhar ji visited the historic India by walking more than 4000 kilometers, when he saw those things that Atal ji used Atal ji, he heard his bhashanon, he was filled with pride.It was also told that in this Sangrhalay, Mahatma Gandhi Sardar Patel Jayaprakash Narayan and our Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru are also very interesting information about the contribution of the country's Pradhanmantriyon, and what can be a good time than the Amrit Mahotsav of freedom to remember the contribution of Pradhanmantriyon of the country. It is a matter of pride for the country that the Amrit Mahotsav of independence is taking the form of a Jain movement, the interest of people is increasing considerably and in such a situation, the PM Museum is also becoming a center of attraction for the youth who are also a center of attraction for the youth.The precious heritage is adding unhehen to the precious heritage, when the colleagues are talking so much about you about the museum, then I did my man that I also see some questions from you, see what your general knowledge says, how much you know how much information you have, you have taken paper pen in handI am going to Pochhne you are going to the answer You are urged that you must answer all these questions, this will increase the interest of people across the country about the museum, do you know that there is a famous rail museum in which city of the country where people have been given Indian Railways for the last 45 years.I am getting a chance to see the heritage, I give you another Kuru.This gem is also the third question Heritage is a Khalsa associated with this museum that you know this museum is present in which city of Punjab, kite is present, I will all be an unable to bhautananda, next question is that the country's only kite museum is added to this, where is Aaiae I give you blue hereThe biggest kite is 22 times 16 feet, the garden has come, otherwise I tell the same thing, I have a special relationship with Bapu, who is not fond of a collection of postal ticket in childhood, but do you knowIs not related to postage stamps in India Where is the National Museum.Know about a museum that celebrates the heritage related to India's textiles, it is very easy to find the miniature painting in this museum.T Due to the importance of the Museum, many people are also coming and doing a lot of dan for the museum. Many people are also dancing their old collections to the museum, when you do this, in a way you do a cultural capitalWe share with the whole society, people in India are now ahead for this, today in changing time and due to some photo girls, new ways are being emphasized in Sangrhalay, the focus on digitization in the museum also bigYou all know that 18 I am international in the whole world In view of this, I have an idea for your young colleagues, why don't you go to see a local museum with your friends market in the coming holidayBy doing, there will be curiosity about Sangrhalay in the man of others. That the whole city will roam around for eight days and take a single money, he will not do it in cash [music] Sagari and the exam exposed the same cashless de out, Sagarika and expected in Delhi wherever Unhen Digital went in Delhi.Payment facility has become available, due to UPI tax code, unhehen cash nikaalne was not needed, even on street food and ready tracks, the Dukaanon of the ready tracks can also think that unhehen online transaction facilities can be thought that Delhi can think that Delhi is Metro City Metro CityBrother, it is easy to all But now it is not that this spread of UPI is limited only to a big Shahron like Delhi, I have also got a message from Ghaziabad Anandit Tripathi, who went to visit North East with her husband last week, from Assam to Meghalaya and Arunachal PradeshI told me the experience of my journey to Tamang, you will also be pleasant to know that in this journey of many days, even in far flung Ilakon, there was no need for Unhen Cash Nikaalne which did not have a good internet facility till a few years ago.Now there too The facility of payment is available. Looking at the Anubhavon of Sagar's Aubhavon, I will also urge you that by experimenting the cashless, see the colleagues, in the last few years, Bhima UPI has become increasingly part of our economy and habits, now now Bhima UPI has become part of our economy and habits nowSo in small shahron and most of the villages also people are transacting from UPI itself, a culture is also being produced in the country due to digital economy.Dena asa It is not unhehen that now there is no problem of open money, you will also feel the facility of UPI every day and you will feel in life every day, you have ever thought of finding the ATM of taking cash anywhere that your small online paymentFrom how many digital economy has been prepared in the country, at this time about 20000 crore transactions are happening in our country every day, in the month of March, UPI transaction has reached about 10 lakh crores, due to this, facility in the country is also increasing and honestyAn atmosphere of is also being created in the country Many new startups related to fantastic are also moving forward. I would like if you also have experience related to this strength of digital payment and starter system, then share Unhen.How the strength of technology is changing the lives of ordinary people, it is constantly looking around us. Technology has reduced another big. It is less. It is less.Sustainable We have seen this in Tokyo Paralympics like sports, so nowadays, the country is constantly trying to make Sansadhanon and Infrastructure accessible to Divyangon.One such institution is promoting the new Avsaron in the field of system technology, who are disabled artists, their lows have also been started for the world to Pahunchane. An example of this is an example of how the challenges are in the life of Divyang comrades, how far they can reach out, you can feel many such subjects in these paintings.With the help of digital technology, you can bring it to the world who are disabled companions, they are also associated with such a Prayason, my beloved Deshvasiyon is the heat growing in most of the Hisson of the country.Also so much Only it increases that you are available in sufficient amount of water where you are right now, but you always have to remember those Karodon people who are Kshetron with water crisis, for which every drop of water is like nectar.Friends, at this time in the 75th year of independence, today at the Amrit Mahotsav of the Had, the country is moving forward with the Sankalpon, Unmen water conservation is also one, during the Amrit Mahotsav, 75 Amrit Sarovars will be built in every district of the country.The big campaign is not far when in your own city 75 will be 75 Amrit Sarovars, I would like all of you and especially the youth that if he knows about this campaign and its responsibility, even if there is any memory related to the freedom struggle in your area, then you can also connect it with Amrit Rover.It was very good to know that after taking the pledge of Amrit Sarovar, it has started rapidly on many sthalon.He was filled with dirt and garbage With the help of local school children by working very hard in a few weeks, he has been rejuvenated by the dirty pond, now he has been retained on the banks of the lake, the retaining wall boundary wall food court is also done and what is the arrangement.I congratulate the Patwari Gram Panchayat of Rampur for this effort to the people of the village for this effort, and the availability of water and the water killer determines the progress and speed of any country. You must have also noticed thatMan is a matter of cleanliness After repeated water conservation with Vishayon, I definitely say in our texts, water is clearly said that we are the basis of the life of every creature in the world, and water is the biggest resource in the world.That is also there, so our purvajon laid so much emphasis on water conservation, to save water everywhere from Vedas to Puranon, it has been said that the social and spiritual duty of man has been described as a social and spiritual duty of man.This is the way Students of history will know how much developed engineering used to be done in India during Sindhu Saraswati and Harappan civilization. In ancient tomorrow, there was a lot of awareness about inter -connected system water conservation in many cities, but today the date is the opposite of this.Everyone is urged, you know about such old Talabon and Saranas of your area, due to the Amrit Sarovar Abhiyan, along with conservation, the identity of your area will also be made, this will also develop local tourism sites in the palaces in Shahron, people will also develop people to visit people. Every effort will be found in a place of the area, every effort related to soon is related to our tomorrow, it has the responsibility of the whole society, for this, different societies have been continuously making different efforts for centuries, such as the tribe of Kach's run, Maldhari water conservationFor class name method is used, under this, small wells are made and trees are planted nearby to protect it. Similarly, its historical tradition of Madhya Pradesh used to conserve water, under this tradition, under this traditionPeople connected to water To find measures, they gather at one place. Due to the suvidhaon found with the Hanuma tradition, the water crisis in this area has reduced, if the feeling of such duty is in the man's man, then the biggest challenges related to the water crisis should be resolved.Can Aaiae today at the Amrit Mahotsav of Adi, we are a resolve to conserve water and live life, we will save the drop water and save every life, my beloved Deshvasiyon must have seen that a few days ago I discussed the exam with my young friends with the student.Many during this discussion Students had sent me in their message as well, I had decided that I will definitely discuss mathematics on mathematics mathematics this time, Mathematics is such a topic that we Indians should be most comfortable with all the mathematicsThe people of India have given the most research and contribution to the whole world, the people of India must have heard a lot about the discovery of zero and its importance, often you must also hear that if there was no discovery of zero, then perhaps we may have probablyEven such scientific progress of the world is not seen All these scientific inventions from calculus to computers are based on zero, Ganitagyon and Vidwanon of India even wrote that this few object beach beach] without pronoun [music] ganiten, that is, without ganiten, that is, everything in this whole universe isSome mathematics is based on mathematics, if you remember the padhaai of science, then you will understand that every principal of science is done in a mathematical formula, it is done by the person in Newton's load, Einstein's famous Equation of Einstein, all the science related to the universe universe is a mathematics.So now Scientists also discuss the theory of everything, that is, a single formula that can be expressed by our scientific understanding of all the scientific understanding of mathematics, our sages have always imagined when we talk about Sankhyaon and numbers in this year.If they speak and think till million billion and trillion, but this calculation goes far ahead in Vedas and in Indian mathematics. We have a very old verses prevalent here. The order of Sankhyaon has been mentioned as a 10 100 1000 and an ordnance and category means that this number goes to Shankar Padma and Sagar.They are difficult but they have been used in Indian mathematics for thousands of years. Just a few days ago, I met in the CEO of Intel Company, they gave a painting in the CEO of Intel Company.Intel's name was done when it came to the company You must have heard about the binary system in computer language in your mind on your own mind, but do you know that in our country, Russian Pingala -like Russian who imagined the binary, similarly from Aryabhata to Aryabhata to RamanujanFor example, till Ganitagyon, we have reduced on how many siddhanton of mathematics have decreased here. Mathematics has never been a difficult subject for us Indians, our Vedic mathematics is also a big reason. In modern tomorrow, Vedic mathematics goes to Shri Bharati Mathematics to Shri Bharati Krishna Ji Maharaj.Calcule The ancient Tarikon of Shan got married and named Vedic Mathematics, the most special thing about Vedic mathematics is that through this you can do the most difficult Gananayen in the man in the blink of the same, nowadays, nowadays, learn Vedic mathematics and learning on social mediaYou must have seen videos of many youths too.Just tell me, Sir, 20 years ago when When he was applying for a joy school, he used to have a competition exam.Bharati Krishna Tirtha Ji Maharaj wrote that and he gave the formula, the Jismein was very simple and very fast. When I read it, I got a lot of inspiration and then I awakened my interest in mathematics, I understood this subject which IndiaWhat is our heritage which is our heritage -In can be pahunchaya in everywhere, since then I made it a mission that Vedic mathematics should be pahunchaya in every corner of the world because the rate of mathematics persecutes every surgeon and what can be the Vedic lecture and what can be Gaurav ji for how many yearsYou are reduced in this, I have been doing it today for 20 years, I am all the Usmein and what do you do for awareness, what uses-how do we go to people, we go to school, we teach online.The name of the institution is the Vedic Maths Forum India under the institution. People are 24 hours Vedic Maths Padhaate through the Internet Sir Sir, you know that I like to constantly talk with children and I keep looking for opportunities and I keep looking for an opportunity, so I have an institutionalize in exactly a wayHe has given more experience that when we talk to the children mostly, they run away as soon as they hear the name of mathematics and my effort is that this reason without this reason is born, this rate should be extracted and small and smallTechnology that is from tradition because India is of mathematics There is no new in the subject, perhaps India has a mathematics tradition in the ancient Paramparaon in the world, so what will you say to the exam warrior, then what will you say that they are most useful for children because the rate of exam is which is air.There is children in every house, children take tuition for exams. Teachers are very upset, so all this gets chhoomantar from Vedic and it comes a lot of confidence in children and the mind also moves fast like we too wrongYoga with yoga is also introduced due to which If the children want, they can also close their eyes and calculate the Vedic mathematics by Paddti.You and you have raised this low in the Mission Board and especially your mother took you on this path as a good guru and today you are taking millions of children on the path, you are taking it on my side very shubhkamnaenNo big scientific problems like Vedic mathematics You can also solve, I would like all parents to teach Vedic mathematics to their children, this will increase their conference, and their brain will not only increase their brain analytical power and whatever is the slight rate in some children regarding Han MathematicsIn my deshvasiyon man's talk will end, many informative vishayon from the museum to me today, all this topic, you become part of the man's talk from Sujhavon of you, I become a part of the man's talk.Keep sending through my village A. In the coming days, the festival of Eid is also coming in the country.Also, you keep following them, next time we will meet again in the talk of the man and will discuss some more new Vishayon, till then there are schools for many Dhanyvad Namaskar [music]"

We have not limited education to book knowledge but it is one of lifeIt has been seen as a holistic experience, the great Vibhutiyon of our country has also been deeply related to education, while Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya ji established the Banaras Hindu University, while Mahatma Gandhi played a role in the construction of Gujarat Vidyapeeth, we played the role of Gujarat. Establishment of education Kendron for a very lovely jagahon, similarly Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore was built in West Bengal, two Ambedkar and Arvindo time inspired many Vibhutiyon for higher education.Singh ji also belongs to King Mahendra Pratap Singh, he gave his home for the establishment of a technical school, he gave a lot of financial assistance for the construction of education in Aligarh and Mathura, a lot of financial assistance to me in Aligarh's name in Aligarh. I have also got the privilege of laying the foundation stone of the university, I am happy that the light of education is still in India, the same life is still in India, do you know what is the most beautiful thing of which feeling is that it is that education is that education is that educationThis awareness is seen on every star in the society, the example of Tayamal ji living in Udam wrapped block of Tripur district of Tamil Nadu is very prernadai. Taymal ji has no land of his own, his family for years and his family has lived up by selling coconut water for years.P is doing financial situation p There was no stone unturned in Adhaane.

You must have seen this Tasviren on social media.In nature and life we This love of Indians was highly appreciated by the caller rang, life gave birth to 29 Shavakon in tomorrow and made Pal POS big and left it as a passionate MLA, this is also the quality of the people of India, we are the quality of love for every conscious creatureLet's make a relationship, one such scene was seen in the Parade of Republic Day this time also in this parade, the Ghod Virat came to Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2003 and every time the commandant on Republic DayLeading the parade as a charger Even when a foreign head of State was welcomed in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, he used to play his role, God gives Army on the Army, but the horse Virat by the SENA chief when my beloved Deshvasiyon is a loyal attempt is less than a good attempt.An excellent example of this has come to light, after taking the name of Assam from Assam, the tea plantation and many national parks are thoughtful, as well as the picture of a singing marigold other van home rhino is also ubharati in our man, now everyone knows that everyone knows thatA lion dirty It has been a part of Assamese culture from the world [Sangeet] A Rabbit Prithvi Prakash [Sangeet] Sathi, the meaning of this song is very beautiful.

Another thing related to the police service that I want to tell the man's words, had become the first picket that only men like SENA and Police only menIt is for it but today it is not so that the Bureau Police Research and Development data shows that in the last few years, the number of women police Karmiyon has doubled in 2014, while in 2014, where their number was close to 125000, while till Twenty20 it was more than 2 minutes.Has increased and The number has now reached 2 lakh 15000, even in the Central Common Police Forces, the number of women has almost doubled in the last 7 years and I do not only talk about the number, the daughters of the country do not only talk about the number of difficult duty and even the hard duty, and the whole strength andHausale is doing it from many daughters, for example, among the most difficult training, special Jungle Warfare Commando is taking its training. Our cobra battalion will be a part of our cobra battalion, today we go to the airport.Cia ESF's brave women are seen protecting every sensitive place. Its most positive effect is reading on the morale of our police, as well as the presence of women Surakshakarmiyon, due to the presence of women surakshakarmiyonNaturally feels coupled herself, due to the sensitivity of women, people also trust them more. I would like to request women police Karmiyon to visit their Kshetron schools after the opening of schools.

Friends, first of all it was not possible to use the real ability of the drone of the Drone kept in this sector so many rules and restrictions in this sector.As it should have been seen, it was seen as a crisis, if you want to fly a drone for any less, then there was so much trouble of license and permission that people would have given up in the name of drone, we decided that thisMindset should be replaced and new trends should be adopted On August 25, on August 25, the country brought a new drone policy, this policy has been made according to the current and future sambhavnaon related to the drone, in which we will not be reading a lot of phones, I will not pay the fees as much as you have to pay before youAfter the new drone policy, who has invested foreign and foreign investment in many drone starters- many Companiyan manufacturing units are also putting orders worth more than ₹ 500 crore to the Army Navy and Indian Drone Companiyon.And it just starts We do not have to stop, we are the leading country in drone technology, so the government is taking all possible steps, I will also tell the youth of the country that you have thought about taking advantage of Avsaron after the brown policy.Smt.

Nowadays a special option is running, this electronic auction is being done by those upaharon which people have given me from time to time, the money that will come from this auction is dedicated to the Namami Gange campaign itself.The man with which the spirit gives me gifts and strengthens the same feeling, the government and social organizations continue to do something for water hygiene to revive the rivers.So dedicate yourself to such works They have done it and this tradition is the same effort, this faith is saving our rivers and when such news comes from any corner of India, there is a shock of great respect for those who reduce such lessEven the man does, tell you that the jalster there is also going very low that he would revive his river, then he added people to Jain partnership, today the river of the companions lost his parties and when the river is filled with water.Does not go, the man gets so much relaxed It has been experienced that many of you will know that on the banks of the Sabarmati, Mahatma Gandhi had built the Sabarmati Ashram. In the last few Dashkon, this Sabarmati river had dried up, there was no 68 months of water in a year but the Narmada River and Sabarmati riverIf you have added it, if you go to Ahmedabad today, then the water of the Sabarmati river cheers such a man, similarly, very few, as we are doing this excuse of our Tamil Nadu, I run in different corners of the country, I know that somewhere we know somewhere our religiousGurujan is a saint associated with tradition Along with the spiritual journey, there are a lot for the river for water, many are running a campaign to plant trees on the banks of many rivers, while somewhere deaf dirty water is being stopped in rivers.I would urge deshvasiyon that one should consider a river festival once a year in India, my deshvasiyon should never make a mistake of considering small things as small things.-Sometimes there are very big changes And if we look at the life of Mahatma Gandhi, then we will feel every part of how much small things were important in his life and how did he government about the big Sankalpon about small things, our government todayThe young man must know that cleanliness Mahatma Gandhi had associated cleanliness with the dream of freedom. Today, after such Darshakon, the cleanliness movement has once again reduced the country with the dream of new India and we are notForgotten cleanliness program [music] and I first But also said that cleanliness is a great tribute of this country to Pujya Bapu and we have to keep paying every time, people have to keep paying every time, people know that I never leave a chance to speak in relation to cleanliness and maybeThat is why Mr. Ramesh Patel ji, a listener after our man, has written that we should also take a pledge of economic cleanliness in the Amrit Mahotsav of this freedom, just as the dignity of the poor in the construction of toilets, in the same way, economic cleanliness to the poorEnsure Rati makes his life easier. The reason for the campaign that the country has started on Jan Dhan accounts is going directly to their account, technology can help a lot in economic hygiene.The general manviy is also connecting, its circulation has started increasing, I will tell you the figure, you will be proud of 355 crore transactions from UPI in a month in the last August, more than 350 crore transactions i.e. we can of 350 crores in the month of August.Since UP has been used for digital transactions, UPI has been used for digital transactions. Today, average 6 lakh crore comrades like Bapu had connected cleanliness with independence, in the same way, we have made the identity of freedom when we are accepting the Amrit Mahotsav of freedomYou can say that today the pride in the movement of the bone is giving that pride to our younger generation, today food and handloom production is many times big and its demand is also big when you also know when Delhi's standing showroomI have been 1 crore in a day, I also remember you again I would like to get that on 2 October birth anniversary, we have all made a new record once again, wherever you are empty bite in your city, the handloom is sold and the festival of Diwali is in front.Do all of you, to strengthen this campaign, all old records should be broken, in this section of Amrit Mahotsav, other gathaon of freedom history in the country is also going on by Pahunchane and for this, Navodaya Lekhakon is going on for this and for thisTo the country and the world The youth of the city were called for this campaign, so far more than a thousand people have registered themselves and that too in 14 different languages and my happiness is that many APRASI Indians in special countriesAlso, to join this campaign, its Chhatraai is another very interesting information on the pages of history, whose names are not seen on the theme on the theme, they have taken the initiative to write something on those ghatnaon on their life, that is, the youth of the country have made itIt is taken to give the history of those independent fighters We will bring in front of Sh, who have not even discussed any discussion in 75 years, my request to Shrotaon is the most related to the education world. You should also inspire the youth, you also come forward and I am sure that today it is less to write history.People who do history are also going to make history, we all know about my beloved Deshvasiyon Siachen Glacier.

Many people have also done solidarity, so why is the general human being of the country today, I have felt this change, I have also seen a wonderful impact of hope in the country, there are also a crisis of challenges.Duni due to many tasks Or many obstacles about the supply chain are chief, but we also created a nationwide problem for a new lesson from every crisis, if the supporter name is that self -reliant colleagues, Abhinav Banerjee, who lives in Delhi, sent his experience to me and sent to Abhinav ji to Abhinav jiPeople would know in the market of buying some toys to give gifts to their relative children. Before it is appointed, expensive toys also mean important toys and cheap toys also wanted weight but Abhinav ji wrote in the letter that Now many shopkeepers there are customers saying that they are demanding India stars in customers in India.It is coming and that too is not easy to figure out this change within a year. Economists can not break it on their parameters. His colleagues can not break me from Visakhapatnam to Venkat Murali Prasad ji from Visakhapatnam.Is that Venkat ji has written I am attaching you my ABCD for 2021 for one, I did not understand anything that after all, I saw that I saw that sister ji kept attaching with the letter, I see it and then understand that theirMeaning self -dependent ABC This is very interesting. A Banquet G has made a full list of all the things that he uses daily that this Muaye Electronics Station Celsius Items include more than that.We know and unknowingly Those whose options are easily available in India, they have vowed that I will use the same product in the hard work and sweat of our countrymen, but at the same time they have said something else that I have found very interesting.He has written that we are supporting self -dependent India, but our manufacturing should also be a clear message for him that they should not compromise the quality of the product, it is right that it is right to work with the thinking of 010 that it is the right time to work with the thinking of 010I am the manufacture of the country and The people of the country urging the country leaders, the people of the country have taken strong steps.Also, I congratulate Venkat ji for his best effort once again, our colleagues have to maintain this feeling and keep on increasing, I have said before and then I will urge the countrymen that you tooMake a list throughout the day Take work in work, investigate all those things and see which things made abroad have entered our lives in a way, in a way, it has been captive in this, find out the options made in India and also decide.That further made in this India that we should use the products made of sweat from the importance of the people of India that you take a new year resolution every year, this time a resolution has to be taken for our country too, my dear countrymen, terrorists in our countryFrom the oppressors, thousands of this country L Old Culture Civilization To save our customs, how many big tied were tied today. Today it is also to remember them. On this day, Guru Govind Singh ji's sons Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh were elected alive in the wall.Wanted that literature left its place and left behind the great Guru tradition, but at such a young age, the enthusiasm of our amazing will be selected while being selected for the will that the wall was getting high, but still China is in the case with the tussle.Guru Govind Sin did not happen today Mother's mother Gujari also gave martyrdom, about a week ago, the day of the martyrdom of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, I have got the opportunity to come to Gurdwara Rakabganj in Delhi, to pay homage to Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji that this month Shri Guru Govind Singh jiMany people inspire people sleep on the ground.Worked we subscribed Once again, I bow to the martyrdom of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Mata Gujri Ji Guru Govind Singh and the four Sahibzadas that many more martyrs have to preserve today's form of India, I have maintained to tell among my dear countrymen.Due to which you are also a cowardly pride that the number of leopards in India increased by more than 60% between 2014 and 2018.Said people who had leopard He has not seen S to see the beauty of its colors and the importance of its gait, not only you can imagine the beauty in nature, that most of the states of the country, especially in central India, the number of leopards increased the highest number of leopards.Madhya Pradesh Karnataka and Maharashtra are at the top of the populated states. It is a big achievement that leopards have been facing threats for years all over the world, their tweets have been damaged all over the world. You showed a way to the whole world, you will also be aware of these things that in the last few years there has been a large number of areas in India as well as in the Indian forest sector, it is because not only the government but many people our trees-It is engaged in the protection of plants and wildlife that world greetings deserve to my colleagues, I had read about a heartfelt effort in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu that you too would see its videos on social media that we all see human chillies but KulaturA child of Gayat Gayatri, inspiring a generation with his father and this can only happen when a person filled with compassion and compassion towards every living being in other cities of Delhi NCR, many people to take care of animals amidst chilling cold.Subscribe to the food of animals doing some and some people who arrange food for hundreds of such animals daily, such efforts should be appreciated.The prisoner cow in jail is going To protect them from the cold, they are covered with old and torn lips. These blankets are collected from the roots of other districts and then they are sealed and sent to Gaushala that the prisoners of Kosambi jail are ready every week.Let us encourage such efforts filled with the appointed service of others.After A stones with these photos It has told about a team of youth who call themselves young brigade, in fact, this young brigade rejected the ancient Shiva temple named Virbhadra Swami located near Srirangapattan in KarnatakIt was not so expensive that one day who has posted a video of this forgotten temple on social media that when the young brigade saw this video on social media, he could not stay and then this teamDecided to renovate it together It is that they took the country shrubs and plants in the temple council, where they needed to be repaired and construction, with the help of local people, people contributed with many more such things with the help of local people.In such a situation, he took time out during the kind of pollution and has worked for the temple that the youth have installed the door in the temple as well as the electricity connection, thus he worked to re-establish the old glory of the temple.Passion and determination The two things from which people can achieve every goal when I feel happy and healthy and healthy and healthy that I am happy and healthy because the youth of my country have a approach to Can Do and Will Do the Spirit someone for themThe challenge is also big that nothing is far from his reach. I read about a teacher from Tamil Nadu. His name is Hemlata NK, who is the world's oldest language in a school in Puram, Tamil teaching Tamil, we do not even go on in our teaching workCome in front of them challenges were needed He recorded an animated video recorded to subscribe to the subscribers of the course and found his students in a pan that it helped his students a lot, he could also understand the chapters as electricity, along with it, he kept talking to his students on the telephone as well.Education became very interesting for this students, the course of Material Creativity in the country and in today's time, all my teachers in online studies should apply all my teachers, Agra Course Material on the Ministry of Education, on the Ministry of Education. IA now talk to students living in remote areas, that Hiraman ji of Korwa tribe of Jharkhand, Hiraman ji, living in Jait village of Garhwa district, you will be surprised to know that Korwa tribe will be surprised to know in mountains and forests away from just four cities.He appointed the culture and identity of his community residing, he is subscribed to the extinction of 12 years of tireless hard work that he has a lot of words from the words used in the Garg road to the Korwa language used in the daily life. It is written with meaning and what Hiraman ji has shown for the community that war is an example. My dear countrymen say that Abu Fazal, the prominent member of Akbar's court, once said that he said that there is such a view in Kashmir that there is such a view in KashmirSeeing that irritable and angry people have also jumped with joy, they were referring to the saffron fields in Kashmir that the body and Kashmiri connected to Kashmir for centuries is grown mainly in places like Pulwama Shopian and Kishtwar.Live Kashmiri Saffron in May Graphic indication i.e. tag is given, through this we want to make loot during Kashmir, Kashmir and spices are famous as many types of medicinal properties are extremely fragrant, its color and its threads are long and thick which are long and thicker which is long and thicker which is to the medicine to the medicine.It increases that it represents the rich cultural heritage of Jammu and Kashmir. Talking about quality, the cancer of Kashmir is very unique and it is completely different from the saffron of other countries. Keep the cancer of Kashmir too hi -tech.Knowing itching It will be Shee that Kashmiri saffron is launched in the super market of Dubai. Now the schools start growing, it will be especially beneficial for our efforts to make it self -dependent and this will be specially benefited by this especially Abdul Majid, who lives in Radheshyam area in PulwamaThat he is selling his G high -tech saffron with the help of National Saffron Mission through trading at the pump and trading center that many people like it are working in Kashmir that next time when you make up your mind to buy your head, KashmirThink of buying saffron The warmth of the Kashmiri people is such that the taste of the saffron is different. My dear countrymen just two days ago, Gita Jayanti was that the Gita inspires us in every context of our life, but have you ever thought why Gita is such a wonderful book.That is because Lord Shri Krishna himself, but the specialty of the Gita is that the questions beginning with the curiosity of knowing that Arjuna questioned God, only then the knowledge of the Gita is that the world got the knowledge of our culture like the Gita, our cultureAs much as in Knowledge begins with all curiosity, Vedanta is the first minister i.e. Brahma Curiosity, that is, we do Brahma Curus, then we are also said to explore Brahma here that the strength of curiosity is such a curiosity, such curiosity, Fal, inspires you for the new.That is why we can have curiosity in us, that is, as long as there is life, as long as there is curiosity, the order of new learning is going on, I do not have any age in this, I came to know the salvation of such energy of curiosity.Tamil Nadu's elderly Srinivasacharya 8290 He is writing his book on computer even at this age about the young Shri T Srinivas Acharya Swami ji, by typing himself, you must be thinking that writing the book is fine but Srinivas Tiwari ji will not be a computer at the time of Tiwari ji, thenHe is true that he did not have a computer in his college time, but he was in his youth as much as the accused was in his youth, in fact, Srinivasacharya Swamiji is a scholar of Sanskrit and Tamil, he has written about 16 spiritual texts so far so far. But after coming to the computer, when he felt that now the way of writing a book and printing has changed, then at the age of six, at the age of six, at the age of 6, he is now completing his grains from the shop required from the computer at the age of 6.The colleagues are Mr. T Srinivasan study is a direct proof that life is full of energy until the desire to learn curiosity in life, so we should never think that we fell behind, we went silent and I wishWe also learn that we should not think that we are not Can't move forward. I could not move forward, my dear countrymen, we were still talking about learning and doing something new with curiosity, they were also returning to new resolutions on the new year, but there are some people who continuously continuously something newThey keep on proving new resolutions, you must have also felt in your life. When we do something for the society, then the results that have been very common in doing a lot, Mr. Pradeep Sangwan, to Guru from 2016, since 2016 and healingHimalayan is campaigning under his team and Reltivated with Ri Rel heavens to different areas of the Himalayas and those who start plastic waste tourism clear Pradeep ji, so far, tension plastic has been cleaned from separate tourist location of the Himalayas, similarly a couple of Karnataka permission and according toShanidev and Minisha have just married in November last month that many youths go for a walk after marriage, but both of them did something different. Both of them always saw that people go out of their house but go there but they go there.Leaving a lot of garbage, leaving garbage today The same situation was on Someshwar Beach of the play, the people who have left the garbage on Anudeep and Someshwar took their first resolve of both the husband and wife, both of them shared about their resolve on social media on Thursday, what was it then what was it then what was it thenImpressed by such a great thinking, a lot of youths have been involved with him, you will be surprised to know that these people together have clarified more than 800 kg of threat from Someshwar Beach.How do we reach these mountains Some such people come and come there and come there, we should conduct a cleanliness drive like Pradeep and approved human beings, but before that we should take a pledge that we will not spread garbage, after all, the first resolution of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is the first resolution, yes oneAnd I want to remind you, oh, due to compassion, it started discussing this year, to free us from single user plastic, it is also one of the 2021 resolutions. Finally, I wish you a lot of best wishes for the new year.You stay healthy yourself to your family Keeps healthy on new topics in January next year, thank you very much"

I have tried to break many myths, I get letters of many such farmers.My point to farmer organizations There is a person who tells how new dimensions in farming, how is the change in farming, which I have heard from them, I have heard from others.That one of our farmers union, he told how there was a time when he had a lot of difficulty in selling his fruits and vegetables outside the market, if he used to sell his fruits and vegetables outside the market, then many times he used to get vegetables many times more.But in 2006, fruits and vegetables were subscribed and around Four years ago the farmers of the farmers established a group up to 15 years ago with the farmers of their village, today the farmers of the village, Sweet Corn and Baby Corn, their products today, their products today, Delhi's Azadpur Mandi big retail chain and five starDirect supply is being done in hotels, farmers of R village are earning 3 lakh per acre from the cultivation of Sweet Corn and Baby Corn, not only this, not only this, more than 60 farmers of this village are making a polyhouse and tomato cucumber capsicum by making a polyhouse.-The variety of variety Every year by producing 10 to 12 lakh rupees per acre, they know that these farmers are different.Now the same strength has been given to other farmers of the country, not only for fruits and vegetables, not only for the vegetables, they are producing in their fields, the wheat mustard mustard barley food, which is growing, according to your wish, to sell them there.Freets have got freedom three-four years ago, fruits and vegetables in Maharashtra three to four years ago This change, which was made out of the purview of APMC, changed the status of farmers growing fruits and vegetables of Maharashtra, Shri Swami Samarth Farmer Producer Company Limited is a group of farmers.About 7 and a half thousand farmers of about 70 villages are sold directly in the markets. An example is the example of Tamil Nadu district of Tamil Nadu, farmer producer company farmer producer company company company has made a group of farmers together and it has been purchased by this farmer group during this farmer group during the purchase of hundreds of vegetables from nearby villages during this farmer group during this farmer group.Towards the city of Chennai, the city has stopped the vegetable, now how many young people they gave employment and the fun is that the farmer was benefited due to lack of middlemen, the group of Lucknow farmers has named it. Intended Farmer Producer Producer Producer Producer ProducersFrom Fruits and vegetables were taken and would go directly from the middlemen about these Lucknow and they wanted to do the story of the farmer very interestingly by doing Ismail Bhai in Banaskantha Rampura village in Gujarat, but their family also felt that thisHow used to do not subscribe, then Dad also refused, but despite the refusal of the family, Ismail Bhai decided that he should do farming, Ismail Bhai had thought that farming is a loss deal, he is a deal of loss and the situation.By changing them but not In a way, he needs potato cultivation and their potatoes have become an identity, whose quality is very good Ismail brother.He paid loans and everyone knows Ismail Bhai today, the help of hundreds of farmers of his area changing their lives, the more modern options we give to farming, the more she will move forward, new methods will come in it, this new innovation will add this new innovation.Living Jai Shanti has started a lotus staff in a lot of discussion due to a new innovation, today, due to his innovation, a new way has been made in lotus cultivation and textile due to his innovation.It wants to take to take 101 years old. 1919 crop was the English government slaughtered innocent people in Jallianwala Bagh.

Old age pension has been released.It is in all these works People of different departments of the government are working on the banking sector people like a team and I will also praise the state governments of our country that they are playing a very active role in dealing with this epidemic.The local administration is the responsibility of the state governments who are fulfilling the responsibility of the state governments, they have a big role in the fight against it, their hard work is very laudable. My dear countrymen from all over the country, the people associated with health services have recently brought the ordinance that has been brought recently on the ordinance that has been brought recentlyYour dissatisfaction It has been done in this ordinance, violence and harassment Arun with Korona Warriors provided a very strict punishment against those who hurt in one form.I am gathering day and night, this step was very important to protect them. My dear countrymen are all experienced that during this fight against the epidemic, we see our life from a fresh perspectiveOpportunity of It has been found that there has been a widespread change in the attitude of the society, today we are realizing the importance of every person associated with our life.People working in me, all of them have a big role, we are feeling that in the same way, people who work in the mandis, our sweet siblings working in the mandis, the auto driver rickshaw drivers of our neighborhood are using todayWithout all this, we like our life It can be done that nowadays we are constantly seeing in social media that people are not only using these colleagues during money, but they are taking care of their needs but are also writing about them with great respect todaySuch pictures are coming from every corner that people are showering flowers on the cleaning workers. Earlier, they also used to not notice their work, doctors should be a cleaning worker.There has been a lot of change in the thinking of common people first As soon as you think about the subject, we did not see anything but our policemen are delivering food to the poor today, the way the police are coming out for every help, the human and sensitive side of policing emerged before us.Hai has shocked our mind, our heart has touched our heart, there is an opportunity in which the common people who are suffering from the police in an emotional manner, they have taken it as an opportunity to serve the public and I am confident that these incidentsTruth in time to come There can be a very positive change in the sense and we all have never painted this positivity with the color of negativity. Friends, we often hear nature-nature and culture, look at these words together and if you look at the expression behind it.You will also see a new door open to understand life, if we talk about human nature, then I use it and this feeling is considered very natural. Someone has no objection to it that it can be called nature.But who is not mine No, I snatch it from another and snatch it and use it, then we can call it a deformity. When someone thinks or behaves a cultured mind above the big nature and distortion, we see culture when someone seems to be a cultureThe cheese of right is less earning with their hard work, whether it is less necessary for yourself or regardless of this, they leave their concern and divide the part of their rights and fulfill the need of someone else, it is a culture, it is a culture.Friends, when the work of Kasoti is done then these qualities Test is not done, it must have been seen in the past, that India took some decisions according to our rites, taking some decisions, taking some decisions, in this hour of crisis, there was a lot of drug crisis for the world also rich in the world.There is a time that even if India does not give medicines to the world, no one considers India guilty, every country is understanding that its priority is to save the life of its citizens too, but friends India has beyond the thinking of nature-natureDecided and decided in India According to the work, we took the decision according to the work, we have increased the effort of what I had to do for India's need, but the call of protecting humanity coming from all over the world should give full attention that we took the initiative to deliver every needy tired medicines in the world andBy doing this work of humanity, today Jumme talks to the heads of state on the phone, then they express gratitude to the people of India when people say Thank you India thank you people of India, then pride for the country will increase furtherSimilarly, it has loads worldwide People should also see the importance of Ayurveda and Yoga on big specific social media and in terms of how India's Ayurveda and Yoga are being discussed to create media on the other side, the protocol given by the Ministry of AYUSH to increase the unity to meIt is that you people must be using it, hot water, long and zone and guidelines have been issued by the Ministry of AYUSH, you will be included in your routine, then you will be very beneficial, friends, it has been unfortunate that many times we many times we will have our powers and rich traditionsIdentifying They do the car, but when any other country in the world is the same on the basis of avident survey research, our formula teaches us, we take it hands-on, perhaps a very big reason behind it has been the period of our slavery of hundreds of years.Because of the reason, sometimes we do not believe in our own power, our confidence is less visible, so we send the good things of our country to our traditional principles and move forward on the basis of research, the disciples leave it and leave it as inferior.India now choose this You have to accept the world yoga, in the same way, the world will also accept the principles of our Ayurveda thousands of years old, for this, the younger generation has to take a resolution and in the language in which the world understands, we have to explain in that scientific language.Friends will have to show something, people are making many positive changes due to humor, our lifestyle and naturally in our habits, they must have felt their own dreams too, this crisis of this crisis is different from under this crisis.Ip And we have awakened our understanding and our consciousness which we are getting around us, the first of them is to wear a mask and keep our face covered and meat is also becoming a part of our life in changing conditions due to compassion.By the way, we have never been used to that many people around us are seen in the meat, but now it has been happening.Miss you all remember that there was a time that our country There were many such areas that if a citizen would have seen buying fruits there, then the people of the neighborhood used to ask him, is there any sick in the house, that is, it means that this disease is eaten in this disease, such a bell remained that time was that timeRevenge and this perception also changed, the perception about the mask is now going to change now, now see that this meat will now become a symbol of society, if you have to avoid the disease and to save others, then you have to put a mask and mySo there is a simple suggestion. The thing is that all of you are understanding what disadvantage of spitting in public places. It was a part of wrong habits anywhere, it was also a serious challenge to cleanliness and health.So always knowing this problem, Diggi was not taking the name of the problem to end the problem, now that time has come to an end forever, it is said that it is said that Better Late Than Never, even if it is late even if it is lateIt has been done, but these things should be abandoned by spitting. Angi infection will also help prevent spreading. My dear countrymen, this is a pleasant coincidence or when I am talking to you, there is a holy festival of Akshaya Tritiya.He is Akshay, in our homes, we all celebrate this festival every year, but its special importance for us is such a day in today's difficult times, it is reminded us that our soul is our spirit, it reminds us that even ifNo matter how many difficulties stop the path, no matter how much you come No matter how many diseases will have to be faced, the human feelings of fighting and struggling are believed that this is the day that the day is the day on which the Pandavas got the renewable character with the blessings of Lord Krishna and Lord Surya DevNever ends, our Annadata farmers work hard for WhatsApp for the country in every situation, due to these hard work, the country has renewable food stores for the poor for all of us today Rivers and the conservation of the entire eco system should also be thought about which play an important role in our life, if we want to be renewed, then we must first ensure that our earth remains renewable that you know that this festival of Akshaya Tritiya donated this festival of Akshaya TritiyaThe power of this power of living is also an opportunity for guava, whatever we give from the spirit of one, it is not important that it is not important that we give knowledge and how much we give that in this era of crisis, our little in this era of crisisMany people around us It can become a very big support for colleagues, even in Jain tradition, it is a very holy day because it has been an important day of the life of Lord Rishabhdev, the first Tirthankara has been celebrated as a festival from Jain society and that is why it is easy to understand.It is that why people like to start any auspicious work on this day, which is a day to start something new today, so can we all together take a pledge to make our earth renewable and indestructible with our effortsToday is also the birth anniversary of Lord Basaveshwar ji, this is my good fortune It has been said that I have got the opportunity to learn to connect Lord Basaveshwar's memories repeatedly with Arun's message, all the followers of Lord Basaveshwar in the country and the world have started the holy month of Ramadan on his birth anniversary on his birth anniversary.When Ramadan was created last time, no one had thought that this time would have to face such a big trouble in Ramadan, but now when this trouble has come in the whole world, then we have the opportunity in front of this Ramadan, this Ramadan has a restraint goodwill sensitivity andMake this symbol of service We pray more than before, so that before telling this, we are free from crying and we celebrate Eid with enthusiasm and enthusiasm as before,We will strengthen this battle against Rana further. Physical distance in markets on the streets is very important.Make people aware about leaving It is really during this dam India time has changed the nature of celebrating festivals around the world, the color forms have changed. Just in the past, we also have a Guthan Do Vishnu Odia New Year of Bihu.He is staying at home and celebrated festivals with great simplicity and auspicious thinking towards society. Generally, he used to celebrate these festivals with full enthusiasm and enthusiasm with his friends and families.Used to do this but someone outside Barta has followed the rules of long gown, we have seen that this time our friends have also made Eastern at home.My dear countrymen will be able to defeat the global epidemic like Korona, amid the crisis of this global epidemic, as a member of your family and you are all my family, then some indications are to give some suggestions that it also becomes my responsibilityI request you Do not get caught in a lot of confidence as soon as we sing, do not always think that in our city in our village, our office has not reached Korona yet, so it is not going to reach now.It is saying something and our hands are said again and again, if the caution has gone, then remember the accident, our ancestors have done very well in all these subjects.Work every khakhara light The fire leaving the fire debt and the disease ES becomes dangerous again as soon as they get the opportunity, so their complete treatment is very important, so there should be no negligence anywhere at the local level in that past evening, always we always take care of it.It will be and I will maintain a distance of once again or two yards, keep yourself healthy, two yards are away.Reports of freedom of some from global epidemic With this prayer that came out of these troubles from Manjat from coming from, thank you all, according to Mp3, all of you are welcome in this program, as you saw that the Prime Minister has seen that through Mann Ki Baat today and not only the country but not only the country but alsoAddressed the world and thanks to all those stake holders"

Our ancestors have accepted the solution of public life value, non -violence. Ahimsa Paramo Dharma has been hearing this since childhood, says that there is faith in political ideologies, whether it is faith in the person, even if it isCome to traditions No one has the right to take the law in the name of faith in the name of faith.Even the person who oppresses on Su, whether it is a person or a group, will ever tolerate this country and no government will tolerate everyone, everyone will have to bend before the law. My love countrymen have become India with diversities and it is diversity.In every behavior We have seen diversity, even our festivals are full of diversities and see the traditions of the scriptures of our Sanskrit heritage thousands of years old, see social traditions, see historical events, hardly no day will grow in 365 days, whereas no one will grow in our placeIt is not associated with the festival and you must have seen that all our festivals run according to the letter at the time of nature, Sita comes with nature. But I would like to call all of you to Dukkadam. In Jain society, the entire body is celebrated tomorrow. Testing is celebrated in Bhadramas in Jain societyForgiveness is also called forgiveness, forgiveness is also called forgiveness, forgiveness is a specialty of a powerful person, that is, who was forgiven and forgiven, both get the blessings of God, my love is my love, my love countrymen every corner of these two HindustanIn Ganesh Chaturthi is popular and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural for public Ganeshotsav, Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and the last 125 years today, before the first bone, it becomes a symbol of freedom movement before the bone today.After independence, society has become a symbol of social consciousness awakening, Ganesh Chaturthi has gone up to 10. This Mahaparva is called Ekta Santa and Cleanliness.Festival of being celebrated It is the main festival. This pav is known for its social and Sanskrit importance. Onam's Pav displays the rich Sanskrit heritage of Kerala. This Pav, along with conveying the message of love and good luck in the society, there is no new enthusiasm in the mother's mother along with the message of love and good luck in the society.Asha awakens new faith, now our festivals are also becoming a reason for the attraction of tourism and I will tell the countrymen that like Navratri celebration in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become a attraction of tourism in a way andFestivals also attracted abroad There is an opportunity to do what we can do in the direction, after a few days, Eid al-gambling will also be celebrated across the country.Publicly urged for cleanliness, not only in the house, but in our country in our entire city, in our country, cleanliness in our country should be an unbreakable part with the festival, my love countrymen have been changing the definitions of being modern.Both a new dimension a A new parameter, how cultural you are, how modern your the process is, it is also a scales in the masses, and that is environment friendly behavior that if there is against it, if it is against it so that it is against it so that it is considered big andGreetings of this, I see that in these two Ganeshotsav also, a friendly Ganpati Manoj has become a big meditation, if you go to Yutub and see that children are making Ganesh ji in every house, making Ganesh ji by bringing soilColor granddaughter is doing some vegetable color There is a piece of paper is sticking, Indians are being used in every family.Friendly Ganesh idols are trained for the idols, they are inspiring guide and as I said, our country has also been India with crores of crores of stunning minds and feels very good when someone knows new innovationAny one There is no engineer who is an engineer himself, he did the training of people to create Ganesh ji by collaborating the soil in a specific way and if he is immersed in Ganesh in a small bucket, then he keeps it in it, then he should be diluted immediately in the water.There is caste and they do not stop here, they gave a lot of Tulsi plant in it and the plant is very much, 3 years ago, it started a campaign of cleanliness, it will be 3 years on October 2 and its positive results are being seen.Both fierce in Gujarat There was a lot of people lost their lives, but when the water was reduced outside the outside, so much dirt failed everywhere, in such a time, in Dhanera in Banaskantha district of GujaratCleanliness like earlier, used to say public meeting, run the glory of Prabhu Seva Cleanliness Service.

Our school is our college our teachers.We can do this and in our country when we talk about transportation, as the mother is remembered in the family, the teacher is remembered in the society, the teacher has a big role in the transportation, the story is in the life of every teacher.Such incidents are from easy efforts Success would have been achieved in transportation of someone's life, if we make collective efforts, then we will do a very big role in the transportation of the nation, I Teej Transform, I am a resident of Ananya Health, I am a resident of Mumbai city and I am a resident of Mumbai city and India Research Center of Harvard UniversityI reduce it under a research, I have been special interest in the financial inclusion, which we call Financial Inklusion, it is related to the related Social Welfare Schemes and my question is that the Jan Dhan Yojana launched in 2014 Can you have shown the figures that after 3 years, India is more strong or more powerful and whether this empowerment and convenience will our women get the laborers even to the village and Kashan.It has been the subject of discussion of the pandits of the economic world.

The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagor. A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagor is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but he was not only the first Asian but he was given the British by the BritishHe was also given the title and when the British did the mangoes at Jhaliya Wala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voice and this was the period when a 12 -year -old child had a profound effect on this incident on the mind of a 12 -year -old child. In a teenage age, the dog laughing in the field barn, the child of Jalliawala Bagh gave a new inspiration of life and in 1919, 12 -year -old child means that we all dear to all of us, we all inspire, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, three days ago, three days agoOn March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that incident of 23 March, that incident of March 23, Bhagat Singh Sukhdev Rajguru's face is not afraid of deathAll the dreams of life were for the freedom of Maa Bharati We had done interest and these three heroes are still the inspiration of all of us.But the British used to worry about how to move forward with them, and then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23 itself.In today's Punjab, the British had quietly burnt many years In the past, when I had got a chance to go there, I used to experience that kind of vibration in that earth and I will definitely say to the youth of the country, whenever they get a chance, when Punjab goes, when Punjab goes, Bhagat Singh Sukhdev Rajguru Bhagat Singh's mother and BatukeshwarIt was a period of time to go in place of Dutt's samadhi, when his intensity of freedom was going on increasing, on one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh Sukhdev Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution, so exactly 100 years from todayFirst 10 April 1917 Mahatma Gandhi Champaran It was a Satyagraha performed this Champaran Satyagraha's centenary year. Gandhi's idea and Gandhi style in the freedom movement of India first appeared in Champaran.This was the period that was the Satyagraha Kheda Satyagraha of Champaran Kheda Satyagraha In Ahmedabad, there was a deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi's idea and working style in all this, Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915 and in 1917, in 1917, in the small village of Bihar.They Based on the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind, that a person who returned to India in 1915, only two years of tenure or countryHe knew that he had no influence, it was still the beginning, at that time, we could have to guess how much hard work he must have had to work, and Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organization Kaushalya Kaushalya Mahatma Gandhi knows the nafs of Indian society.Power of Mahatma Gandhi up In front of the British Sultanate by behavior, to motivate the poor to the poor to the poor to the struggle for the struggle, it gives it a wonderful power and hence the form we experience Mahatma Gandhi's greatness.But if Gandhi thinks Gandhi of 100 years ago, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha, for anyone who starts a public life, Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of very study.Is And we can learn how Gandhi did it and that time was the time we hear the names of big leaders, Rajendra Babu Ho Acharya Kripa Ji was sent to the villages at that time, people joined the peopleWorking working, giving color to the color of freedom was taught its methods and the British could not understand what is the way Gandhi's way of struggle.One aspect of one coin was covered and the other aspect creation should be filled with jail on one side To spend yourself in creative works on the other side, a very wonderful balance was in Gandhi's working style. What is the word Satyagraha. What can be disagreeIt was established by experimentation, today when the country is celebrating the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha, then how immense the power of the general human being of India is, like the freedom movement, the journey from Swarajya to Swarajya to Swarajya, the journey from self and a quarter million countrymen The culmination of Regram Sarvajan Sarvajan Sarvajan Sukhay Sukhay will make the united effort to do something for the country for the country with this original mantra, it will realize the dreams of those great men who have died for freedom, today when we are living in the 21st century, then who is HindustaniThis will happen that would not want to change India, who will not want to become partners for changes in the country. This is the attempt to change this change of 125 million countrymen, this is the attempt to change the new India New India will put its strong foundation.Neither government There is a program nor is there a manifesto of any political party nor is it any project.Hope there is a resolution, there is a resolution, there is a desire, my dear countrymen, if we move away from our personal life, we will see the activities going on in the society from the sight of the journey, we will try to understand what is happening next to us.So we will be surprised that Kshe Vadhi people are selflessly responsible for their personal responsibility, in addition to the disadvantaged victims for the society, they are seen doing something for the poor, and they also do penance like the mouth servant, they do asceticismThere are many people who go to the hospital regularly. Many people go to the hospital. Many people run for blood donation.Public service is Prabhu Seva in our veins Hai, if we see it as a collective once, then it is a great power when it comes to New India, then it is very natural to see it from a different perspective and it is very natural in democracy but it is unlikeIt is true that if 125 million countrymen take determination and decide the path to prove the resolution, then the dream of New India can prove to be in front of our eyes and not necessarily everythingBajet is from government project It is a government money if every citizen resolves that I follow the rules of traffic if every citizen resolves that I am responsible for me, if every citizen resolves that every citizen resolves that one day a week I am of petrol dieselI will not use things in my life, you see that you will see this country who are dreaming of New India, who are looking for a million countrymen, will be able to see it in front of your eyes.Do duty by performing duty This can become a good start of New India in itself. Let us be 75 years of India's independence, Bhagat Suts Sukhdev remember Rajguru, remember the Satyagraha of Champaran, so why don't we too from Swarajya to SwarajyaIn this journey, by disciplining your life by disciplining your life, why should I invite you, I want to thank you, my dear countrymen, today I want to thank you today, in the last few months, such an atmosphere in our country has created a very large amount of digital payment in our country.DG Dhan Movement How can a cash transaction be done without attending, his curiosity is also bigger, and the poor are trying to learn even the poor and gradually how people are moving towards him without cash business, D Monetisation Digital has been digital since demonetisationThere has been a lot of increase in different methods of payment, even after starting it, it has been a time of two and a half months, but so far about one and a half crore people have loaded it downloaded against my dear countrymen, black money against corruptionWe have to take the fight forward crores of crores In this one year, people can resolve to work as a thousand crore digital transactions in this one year, can we announce in the budget, if they want to work for one and a quarter of the country, we can not need to wait a year in six months.There are two and a half thousand crore digital transactions, if we fill the fee in school, we will not fill with cash, we will stay with digital, we will stay in the railway, we will stay in the aircraft, we will pay from digital, we will buy medicines, we will buy medicines, we will do digital payment.do You can do this in Mara's life everyday, you are not imagined, but with this you can do a lot of service to the country and you can become a brave soldier for the fight against black money corruption.Many programs of Dhan Mela were held, resolve to do 100 programs across the country. 8085 programs have been done, in which there was a reward scheme. About 125 lakh people have received consumer prize. 700 Haj people have received the reward for the traders.And everyone has forwarded this work It has also resolved to carry out 14 April Dock is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and it was decided long ago, on 14 April, this DG fair is going to end on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14 April.There is going to be a big program, there is a provision of a very big draw in it.Let us contribute my dear countrymen I am happy that every time I ask for suggestions from people for the matter of mind every time, there are many types of suggestions, but I have seen that every time I keep an urge about cleanliness, I am a one of the name of Gayatri from Dehradun.The daughter who is a student of 11th, has sent a message and sent a message to the respected PrincipalI want to say that people It has to be explained how important cleanliness is, I go through the river every day in which people also put a lot of garbage and contaminate the rivers, the river comes from the response moment and also comes to my house.For the river, we went to the settlements and took out a rally and interacted with the people, but I did not want to tell you that I want to tell you that by sending a team or by the newspaper, this thing should be destroyed by thanks.How much pain is the pain of a daughter of a class Seeing the garbage, how angry he is getting angry.Something will start doing something against dirt and it is good that Gayatri is also expressing her anger as well, but at the same time he is also saying that she has made a lot of efforts but failure has been received since cleanlinessThe movement has started awareness has come to everyone It has been positively connected to it, it has also taken the form of a movement, hatred towards dirt is also increasing. There should be an active participation, it has its own importance but it has its own importance but is more related to the cleanliness movement.This movement is a movement to change the habit. This movement is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness. The movement can be done collectively, but it is believed that in the new generation of the country, there is a feeling that is awakened among the youth among the students among the students among the children in the new generation of the country.It is good in itself The result indicates the result, in today's my mind, whoever is listening to Gayatri, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be made for all of us, my dear countrymen, since I am starting the program, I am starting the program.I continued to get many suggestions on one thing and most people have expressed concern about food waste, we know that we also take more in the plate in the family and even in the collective food conference.Fill in the whole plate and Then you are unable to eat, half of the plate we do not fill in the stomach and then you leave it there, you have ever thought that we have to leave how much we do with what we do with thisIf you do not leave, then how many poor people can fill their stomach, it is not such that when the mother is served in our family, when the mother is served, then she says that as much as the son can eat as much as you can eat.But still apathy on this subject is a society malicious with the poor The other is injustice, if there is savings, then the family also has economic benefits, it is a good thing for the society, but this subject is such that there is also the benefit of the family, I am not urging more on this subject but I would like to increase this awareness to increase this awarenessI should know some youths that those who run these types of movement, they made a mobile app and if there is such a kind of joy, then people call all the words and use it well and work hard and we work hard and our countryThe youth of India say in every state of India Somewhere you will find such people, their lives can also inspire us, we should not take it as much as we see for change, these are the way for change and people who are aware of body health always say that they always say.Keep the stomach slightly empty. Keep the plate a little empty and when it comes to health, World Health Day is World Health Day.7 April World Health On the subject of depression on this day, depression has been focused on this time, we are also familiar with the word depression, but if literally meaning is to be made, then some people also call him depression.More people are mentally suffering from depression.Nothing says because he feels a little embarrassment I would like to say to the people that depression is not such that it cannot get rid of a psychological atmosphere and it starts. The first mantra is the need for its expression insteOpenly say what is happening with the teacher among the brothers among the father, sometimes the children living in the hostel get more trouble, our country is fortunate to have a big fortune that we are big families in the joint family.It is interacted And due to this, the possibilities of depression ends, but still I would like to tell the parents that you have ever seen that your son or daughter or any member of the family earlier when you used to eat food but one used to eat but oneThe family person says he does not say, I will eat later, he does not come to the table.Must believe that it is the first step in the direction of depression if it is in the group Hanna does not like it alone going into a corner, so try it to do not let it happen openly, give him the opportunity to stay in the middle with such people and talk openly.While doing it, motivate him for expression, take out which frustration is lying inside it. It is a good solution and depression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases, such as diabetes becomes a compassion for all types of diseases, so the depression also fights.Deciding to dare That destroys all our capabilities. Your friend. Your family, your campus, your environment can stop you from going to depression and you can bring it out, then there is another way if you are in the middle of your loved onesIf you are not able to do your expression openly, then do one thing, go somewhere to help people with service somewhere in the next side.If you try to understand, you will do a service in you New confidence will be created by serving someone by joining others and if you serve with selfless spirit, then you can lighten the burden of your mind very easily, so yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy with stressRelief from liberation pressure, the happy mind and Prayan Yoga helps a lot on 21 June International Yoga Day. This will be the third year, you should also prepare from now and millions should be celebrated in a number of collective yoga festival in your mind in connection with the third international yoga day in your mindIf there is any suggestion then come Please send me your suggestions through my mobile application.I would like it because today the discussion of health has come out of health, then in the past, the Government of India has made a big important decision in our country, the working class which is our women in the working class and their number is also increasing day by day.Their Shri participation is increasing and it is welcome, but at the same time the woman also has a special responsibility or the family responsible for the financial responsibility of the house, or she also has to participate in her and due to that sometimes a newborn babyInjustice is done to the Government of India. The women of the working class have taken a big decision. At the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery at the time of delivery, the maternity leave which used to get 12 weeks earlier will now be given 26 weeks, probably two or three in the world.The only countries that are ahead of us India has made a very important decision for our sisters and its basic purpose is taking care of that newborn baby, in the early period of India, his mother gets a lot of love, if he gets a lot of love, then this child is growing up with our country.The health of the mothers will also be good and hence it is a very important decision and due to this, about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector will get the benefit of this, my dear countrymen are the holy festival of Ram Navami on April 5. Rir Jayanti is the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14 April. This life of all the great men kept inspiring us, give the strength to resolve for New India.Many best wishes, this is the time to start crop ripening after spring and farmers are celebrated in different corners of our country in different corners.Sindhi Cheti Chai as year Samvatsar Puja in the region of Vand Kashmiri Navare Avat, joins in Mithila, Bihar, Sheetal and Satwani's festival in Magadh is on the new year countless India is a country full of such diverse.Thank you [music] [music] Hello all of you are welcome in this special broadcast, I am Rama Tyagi Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the three edition of his mind, has talked to Swaraj today with Swaraj for New India, for this, for this, for this, for thisTime"

I want to urge the youth especially, now very active on social media, this time the heroes whose heroes got this honor this timeHave you search on the net, write two good words regarding them and deliver it to your comrades, when we know about the valor of the valor of their courage, then we are surprised.Time in Kashmir कारी Hamara, who has dated our Jawan country, pay tributes, my young colleagues January February, April April, every month, every family is in every family, children have children's exams in the house, but the whole family is burdened with exams.If it happens, my mother has done that this is the right time that I will talk to the student friends, talk to their parents, I should talk to their teachers because for many years, where I got the exam, the examination was a big problem, the family worried upShik A big bizarre psychological environment is seen in every house and I have always felt that I should come out of it and so I want to talk in some detail with the young colleagues today, send the message to the students, send the question.He also referred to the troubles of the pain and after seeing it, I want to decorate the thoughts in my mother today, I got a telephone message, you should also listen to the creation, what is the creation of the creation.So I have you I want to ask the tauta whether this atmosphere cannot be fragrant, this is the fascination of enthusiasm, you have to decide that you will consider it a plaser that you will consider the pressure that will be considered a placer which will be considered as a pressure and hence my opinion is a celebration which is a celebration which is a celebration.The best is better than the best, in general we feel how many of us are, but when we look at the arrangement of 40 45 days of Kumbh Milo, then it is found that in the exam, the whole family will be converted into the whole family, the celebration will make the full atmosphere free and I will make it free and IParents more in it I say with an urge that you have created an atmosphere of a festive month for these three months.The state was this three tax month examinations, the examinations are done by the month, we all change the responsibility of all of us, you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed, then your years old things are also easily remembered you are a caste.What did the teacher say in the classroom a year ago Shy is remembered and you should know that the power will recall the memory that is the highest in relaxation. If you are under stress, then all the doors are band.He stays in Bhima, he becomes a burden in itself. You must have seen yourself in the exam too, you remember the book, remember the chapter, remember the page number, I remember the page on the top in the page that it is also written on the bottom.A goes but that perticular word is not remembered but like giving exams You come out and Chanak, who comes out of the room a little bit, remembers you, yes, why did this word come inside, no one had told it, but what was inside was immediately outside, if there is any medicine, then there is relaxation and there is a relaxation andI say this by my nature because if there is pressure, then we forget our things and we can never imagine, suddenly ICC is a recall, very few are a caste and it is not that you do not have knowledge that you do not have knowledge.No, you do not just have information, it is not that you have not worked hard When there is tension, then your knowledge your knowledge is your knowledge below and your tension becomes a voice on it that we are unable to see the exam in Proper Perspective.You are going to give him the exam of your studies in a year, what kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you want to live life.Opportunities must have come to pass through the criteria and therefore the exam The success of life has to be done with success, get rid of such burden, in front of us, our former President has failed to be Bharati in C.If you go through life, then India will get such a big scientist, such a big president is not found, as well as tension in the students is also very flooded, so I would like to be aware of your thoughts about the present direction and your future in the same way in lifeNot everything Life happens, how much knowledge you have acquired, you have tried to live what you have known, do you have life that you have got a sense of mission and which is your sense of ambitionThis is happening in the middle of your mission and ambition, if you believe in these things, then you will be behind you, asking Marx, you will never have to run away after March, you will never have to run away after MarchConfidence is coming to come less is going to come down You are the one who tells me that your family will have a doctor and everyone of the family will go to them, there will be a family doctor.You must not have asked that you just thought that brother is good for the doctor, you are getting benefiting from people, you start taking his service, you see his experience of his knowledge of his success and hence it is the burden of number, that too ever-Then it happens and if you close your own life closely If you look at it, it will come to mind that if you go behind the position, then you will become shortest plastic, you will catch the selected things and you will find it, but if you put your hand on the things you have prepared from the question you had prepared from the question you had prepared fromIf the question is out, then you will be very down, if you keep the knowledge at the center, then you try to cover up a lot of things in yourself, but if you follow the marks, you follow the marks, then you slowly to yourself, then you slowly to yourselfYou shrink and limit yourself to a certain area Rakh Marx can only be for himself [music] The competition to carry forward life has not come down.How to get better tomorrow from tomorrow, how is the opportunity to come more better than the passage of passage, often you have seen it in the sports world because it immediately understands it, so I give the example of sports world.That if we follow if we To take the example of Reaman Sachin Tendulkar ji for 20 years continuously, it is a very amazing life journey to defeat himself every time and move forward because he adopted the path of complication more than competition, friends and answers in every field of life.He is going to give the exam, then if he was able to read for two hours, he was able to do three hours in peace, first he used to be raised at the morning, there was a fear that you could get up on time, would you not sleep in the tension of the first examination.Was it sleep now Take yourself to the test and you will come to mind that the defeat in competition gives rise to desperate and despair and jealousy, but Anusha introspection is divided by self -thinking. Sankalp makes the power firm and when he defeats himself, moreThe enthusiasm to carry forward is born on its own, there is no extra energy from outside, if I have to say in simple language, if you are better if you are better, then you will be unhappy and unhappy with jealousy.Jeal you will fill you on their own Will eat and if you are equal, then you will not feel the need for improvement as if you keep moving, then I urge you, I urge Anusvar, will compete with myself, what did you do before, how will I do it, how will I do it, just on this, just on thisFocusing, you see you will feel a lot of change, Mr. A. Sundar ji has expressed his feeling in relation to the role of parents, he says that the role of parents in the exam is very important and ask me to ask the question of mathematics.She was Answer and in this way [music] Sundar ji is right, and you must have seen even today, you have more number of women who ask questions, because the mother who is alert in relation to the future of hair in the house is active.She makes a lot of thing simplifies a lot, I would like to say so much to the parents. We change on three buttons.The maximum problem is ended Every parent will feel this, the expectation of the parents is at the root of the teachers. The path of the solution of the accepting problems is to open. The expectations make it difficult to keep the situation the opportunity to open new paths and therefore which is what is it.We keep discussing the hymns of the school bag of young children, but sometimes I think the expectations of the parents are expected that the child is more heavy than the school bag, caste is more than many years ago.Famous person ha When Karan was in Hospital of Rut Attack, his son of our India's first Speaker Ganesh Dada Malankar, his son Purushottam, he was also an MP, he has come to see his health. I was present time to him and I saw that he came and saw that he came and came and came to his health.I did not ask a single question and as soon as he came there, what is the situation there, how did the illness not be heard, and within the first two minutes, he made such an atmosphere lightly, in a way, in a way, the insurance person goes like that we have a diseaseParents give I would like to say to this, sometimes we also do the same with the children, do you ever think that both of the children have any atmosphere of laughter, now see that the atmosphere will be cloudyJaan does not want to tell his name, after listening to the phone, you will know that he does not want to tell his name, Hello Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I had done something less, I had done something like this, I did not cheat once in my childhood in my childhood.I tried to prepare a lot for that I tried to find the triangle of how I could copy, due to which my time was wasted a lot of time, I could read it as much as I spent as much as I spent in mind to copy to copy.And when I tried to pass by copying, I was lying in it and because of me many friends around me have a lot of trouble, it is right for you.There is never to believe in herself, the mother does not believe in herself Just look at me, confirmed what I have written is not right and sometimes we have written correctly, but if the next person has written a lie, then we sometime accept this jat and we also go motherSo copy never benefits, so do not copy, you must have heard many times and again and again that do not copy, do not copy, I am also again the same time, you can see copy in every form.On the way to the way and dragging you and if the inspector caught you in the exam, then everything is your It will be married and mother takes no one, then there will be a direction on your mother throughout your life, and whenever you have to understand your children, you will not be able to explain by mixing your eyes in your eyes, ohThere will never be a desire to learn anything in life, then where will you reach, mother, you are converting your paths into a mattress and I have seen that there are some people to use so much talent to find ways of copyingThey make so much investment Whatever is, they spend the same way in the way of copying, if you give the same time on the issues of your exam, then perhaps there is no need to copy, the results that will be achieved by the results of your own hard work will increase, the soul will increase with it, a phone will be enough.Tomorrow has come [music] You will talk to Aashiqui, they will be angry. What is the Prime Minister, children have been playing in the time of exam, because there is usually such a picket that if students pay attention in sports, then education is made by education.Basic strike is wrong, the root of the problem It is the same that if you want to do all -round development, then there is a life outside the books and it is very huge, this is the time to learn to live it, there is one one that I should first complete the sari exams and play it later later.So it is impossible that this is the time of molding of life, in fact, in my point of view, three things are very important, so the rest of the body should also get physical activity, now whatever you are doing, take a little break and go out and go to the kitchen.Look at your choice If you get the biscuits of the Sand, then the gap joke a little laugh, you will feel that you are becoming less simple, everyone does not like it, but I do not know but my experience is the experience, if you do this time, then it is very beneficial.The body will be relaxed and the relationship that makes the body the relationship will not waste, it will not waste your reading time, it will increase the strength of reading, your concentration will increase, your freshness will come, freshness will be freshness.Hold meetings in elections If I am sometimes my voice is a caste sitting, then I came to meet a folk singer and asked me how many hours do you sleep, brother, why are you a doctor, what did you not say, what is your voice, your voice which gets spoiled while speaking at the time of elections, his voice is spoiledThere is a relationship with this, you will get a full sleep, then your tomorrow code will get full rest, now I had never thought to sleep and my speech and my voice. They gave me a herb, just kept sleeping but will say something, the Prime Minister motherWisdom Shri is preparing to keep him alert and I I am sitting in the mother's button, maybe I have told the things that I have told, if you may not be a burden, then do not do it, otherwise it will become a burden, if I will become a burden, then I will become a burden, so as I am my family's parentsFather also applies to me, remembering his resolve and trusting me, go for the exam, on this occasion, I thank all the officers and soldiers of the course garden for their service towards the nation, this prideIt is a matter of talk that all its 126 manufactured in Koshigard country And with 62 aircraft, the world's tax is maintaining its place in the midst of employment, Vayam protecting its motto to make the country's beach clean to secure the sea boundaries and marine environment, and to make the beach of our country clean andThousands of people attended it, along with the Coastal Security, the post clins also worry about it, and very few people will know that in our country, not only men in employment, not women, not only women, shoulder to shoulder and should be responsible for the society form or fulfill their responsibility.Has been And is successfully playing India's coastal security and maritime security is made of an important subject, then I congratulate him very much on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Cast Garden, on 1 February, the festival of Basant Panchami is the festival of Basant Panchami on 1 February.The king is a very big festival of Basant Panchami Saraswati Puja in our country, not only that, inspiration is also a pav of inspiration for the heroes.Best wishes my love country I am always a new color to the residents of the residents of the residents of the residents of the residents, I have started reciting the mother's talk in the regional speech soon after the completion of my mother's talk.People are writing chities. I greet Akashvani very much for his own inspiration, I also greeted you very much among the countrymen, I give a big opportunity to connect me with my mother."

Jan Dhan Yojana and the bankThe employee had raised him on his shoulder in the way and what he did not do in 70 years, he showed his capable and then once he has taken him the challenge and I am confident that the countrymen have taken care of crores of countrymen.Resolve everyone's collective effort Will make the nation a new force by creating a new strength, but the evils are so spread that even today, some people are not habit of evils, still some people feel that this money of corruption money benami money is a way to find some way and again in the systemFrom La Dun, he is looking for an illegal way to save his money, that he has also liked the way to use the poor, by making the money to save money by dumped money in their accounts or by reducing someone from them.I am trying to such people today I want to improve N Improve N Recorulation N: To follow your wish, you will be able to see the law.If my love is poor in trouble due to your sin, and such a rigorous law of benami property has been made in which there will be any difficulty and the government does not want our countrymen to have any difficulty.This 500 and 1000 middle The fight against corruption and wealth tomorrow has been telephone to me.It has been very commendable that I will welcome for many examples in my mother's talk and the system is very important for nation building and I am with the whole country and I am very happy that you have notes a thousand money notes bandsI gave me a call from Karnataka This Lapa Velting has come from JeeYou will raise tomorrow, taught money and a lesson to the corrupt and a citizen of India will never come better on this, for this, I want to thank you mother, some things from the middle of the media from the middle of the people from the middle of the government sources from the media.If it is, the enthusiasm to reduce is also very flooded It is so happy that it is so much a village that what is wonderful about the general human in my country, there is a national highway or 6 restaurant in Akola, Maharashtra, they have put a very big board, so do not worry about money, do not go hungry from hereGo after eating and then go through the way, you definitely go to the opportunity by giving money and people go there, then they also give money, it is also a lot of money, this is the strength of my country which has a sense of service and authenticityAlso, I used to discuss tea in elections and It had reached all over the world, people of many countries of the world had learned to speak on tea, but I do not know that there is marriage in discussion on tea, I came to know that there was such a wedding in Surat on 17 November.With the discussion on marriage tea, a daughter in Surat in Gujarat, a daughter who came to her wedding, only drink tea and did not do any jalasa, Nokhana program was nothing because due to demonetisation, there was some difficulty due to demonetisation.Honor is considered to be a corruption of corruption from the middle of his marriage The contribution that is going on against the money against wealth tomorrow is inspiring in itself. I also give a lot of blessings to Navneet India and South and converting the wedding opportunity into this great yagya in a new occasionI congratulate me for the reversal and when such crises come, people find wolf on the way.Stay with tea and get attained weekly, now you get ₹ 2000 note If he got it, what did he do [music], he would not have to do small e because Chand has to play together and did that he will meet the next week, then he will take his account and sit on his own and see its change.The government has come to a message from the people of T Garden of Assam that our ITM has been installed, see how there is change in the life of the village, some people have got immediate benefits of this campaign, the country has got the country immediately.Both will be found but some people have got immediate benefits Saab asked what has happened, so I have got some information about the small city, which I got, which I got to bandage, people did not give money to tax water, due to this note band.Tax, not giving electricity, does not know the money, does not know that poor people have a habit of going to pay and pay the pie, who do not know that they do not know that they are never going to ask them, they do not pay the same money.And for this, there is a lot of arrear relief for every Munshi party. It comes 50% from Li, but this time, due to the decision of the 8th, everyone ran to submit their old notes, in the 47 urban units, last year, about 3:30 thousand crores was deposited at this time, it is natural if the money was deposited.On the one hand, amidst the difficulties due to this new change of economy, everyone is adjusting himself, but I want to especially greet my country today, now I was taking the figures of sowing of this cropWheat whether it is wheat or pulses or oilseeds, till 20th of November There was an account of sowing in the mantra compared to the previous year, there is a greetings in the mantra, the government has also made many important decisions in which even after giving priority to the village, there are difficulties, but I believe that the farmer who has our every difficulties,Even while facing, there is always relief from standing and standing at this time, even small traders of our country give unemployed, the economic activity increases. In the last budget, we had made an important decision.Because my whey is big If L gets 24 hours, then why should the poor shopkeeper of the village not get it from the Mudra Yojana for a lot of institutes to give them lakhs of crores of rupees from the Mudra Yojana to such small people because these small businesses in crores of peopleThey do and urban gives momentum to the business of carbon rupee, but due to this decision, it was natural for them to have difficulty, but now I have seen that now even our small traders also from the middle of the mobile up to the middle of the mobile bank from the middle of the mobile bank.Between credit card Since your own way, customers are serving on the basis of confidence and I want to tell my younger business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you should also enter the digital world, you too can also get banks up on your mobile phoneDownload, you too, for credit card, you can also get business without a note.No question raises raise I invite the opportunity to invite you that you can make a huge contribution in creating a cashless society. You can create a complete banking system on mobile phones in increasing your business and today there are many ways of notes, there are many ways that we can run businessTax paths are safe. Sikar is Sikar and I would like you only help you to help this campaign success.Technology basis But I can reduce my belief, I want to say to the laborers brothers and sisters too, you will be very exploited, there is a salary on paper and what is given in hand, then another is there, sometimes if you get Pagrapura, then someone stands outside.And the laborer forced this exploitation to make this exploitation a part of life. With this new system, we want your bank's account to be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wedges are followed by the minimum wedges, you should not get any money.Do not exploit you and once in your bank account If you go, then you too have no big smartphone on a small mobile phone. Nowadays, your mobile phone also reduces the son, you can also buy whatever you have to buy in a small pearl shop from this mobile phoneI can also give a special request to laborers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because finally I have taken such a big decision to the victim for the poor for the poor for the laborer for the laborer for the victim.I want to talk to young friends especially today I want to say with the yard o'clock in the world, India is such a country that has 65% of the population of 65% of the age of 35 years.That you support this decision. I also know that you also contribute a lot to pursue this matter positively, but friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion, you are my true companion, a wonderful to serve Mother Bharati.The opportunity has come in front of us to take the country to economic heights The opportunity has come to my youth, you can help me, do I not talk to the dog with so much, as the experience of today's world, the older generation can not be able to know the elder brother in your family and you will not know even and mother-Father uncle uncle uncle Mama Mani will probably not know what you know, you know what is online banking, you know how online ticket booking is, you know what is very common for you and you also use it but today the country todayYes, we want to do great work The floor of the cashless society will not be overcome and I want your physical help in this, I want my own resolve and you will never be unhappy, I believe in the world because we are all the people who want to change the life of the poor of India, you know you know youHow many opportunities are there for digital banking for cashless society or for mobile banking. Every bank provides online facility. Every bank in India has its own mobile up. Every bank has its own wallet.Tax of India under Poor families have a rupee card and after the 8th, the rupee cards used to be used very less, the poor started using the rupee card and about 300% has increased like it has increased like a prepaid card in the mobile phone.By the way, banks get prepaid cards to spend money. There is a great platform. You can also send money as you send to WhatsApp as you will not be educated person, how do you know how to send WhatsApp today too todayDo not only take it Jnology is becoming so simple, for which low a big smartphone is also required. Simple feature phone is also cash transfer. Dhobi is a washerman. The vegetable is sold, the milk is sold, the milk should be sold, the newspaper is sold, whether the newspaper is sold, whether it is sold, whether it is sold.Everyone can be able to use it comfortably and I have also added to make this system more simplified and all the banks are engaged in it and now we have also cost online surchargeThat too has canceled and you have seen this type of card, and you have seen In the last two tax day, all the expenses in the newspapers have ended all the expenses so that the movement of the cashless society will get hair and all of you know like this, I know like this great work, it is active in this great work.Cartoon new imagination laughing joke in everything and amidst challenges, it is the power of our younger generation, so it is like this is the specialty of India land that in which era, the Gita was born in the battlefield in which era.It was likewise today from yesterday of such a big change I have been a Gujjar, then the fundamental creativity is appearing in you too, but my love young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this low and you are confidentMake the right resolution today that you will become a part of yourself for the cashless society yourself. All the technology to spend online on your mobile phone will be present, not only this, not only every day, after taking half an hour hour and 2 hours every day, at least 10 familiesWhat is this technology of technology How to download your banks up from how to spend the money in your account, how can the shopkeeper be given how to teach the shopkeeper how to trade you will voluntarily do this cashlessThe great campaign to bring out these notes out of the circle of these notes, the campaign to free the country corruption, yesterday, the campaign to liberate the country from money is to lead the difficulties to free people from the problems.This is Arrangements Shikha Dog, she will probably get rid of the saree chitta and if all the youth of India go away, I do not believe that within a month we can stand as a new modern Hindustan within the world.And you can release this less your mobile phone and can do it in 10 houses every day and add 10 houses to it, I invite you, I am not only supported, we do not support this change and only with changes.The country will be happy with corruption and money tomorrow We will take forward the fight to do the fight and there are many countries in the world where the youth gave him a cloud to the life of the nation.

The world will play the world, every country in the world will have to keep an eye on the performance of its players closely, if you keep it, then there is a lot of Indian government in DelhiPlay and play a great event we did Also, wherever there are in the coming two, do something to do something to encourage our players, the player who reaches after hard work does a kind of rigorous penance. No matter how much is fond of eating, everything has to be left.Even if you intend to sleep in the cold, you have to leave the bed and run away in the field and N. The only players also have the same strength behind their children with the same enthusiasm.Is it to reach this game simultaneously He is also more important than that and that is why all the countrymen who have gone to the Olympics are ready to become the Prime Minister Postman of the country.Like millions of countrymen, a countrymen will be with a citizen of a citizen, I will be with you for our players, I will come with you, all of us, one player started in this Mahakumbh of the plays outside the competitions, In this Mahakumbh of Khelo in Rumjhum Ki Rumjhum, India's start in Riya Ki Rumjhum, it should be the beginning of India, Sony silver and bronze should be the beginning of India.Target Soni Pe Ho target Soni Pay Ho Nirsa Tum Ko Na Nirsa Tum Nirsa Tum Kon on Con, May youSuraj ji, I offered your expressions to all these players I will do and my best wishes to hoist the flag of Hindustan in Riya on behalf of crores of countrymen, the country and the world paid tribute on the death anniversary of Abdul Kalam ji, but whenever the name of Abdul Kalam ji comes, our eyesIt gets marked in front of and hence Ankit has also written that what your government is doing to do the dreams of Abdul Kalam ji, your point is right and technology is the most playful.Creates new effects It keeps changing, you cannot have technology, you will go to cook, till then the story is a new form with a new form and if we have to get it less and have to take it forward, then research and innovation for us too is the life of technology.If research and renovation are not done, then as the water is spread, technology is also a burden and if we live without research and innovation, we will live in the world, then we will become brother in the world tomorrow and therefore the new generationAttractions towards science in Research and innovation towards janology means that Atal Innovation Mission is promoting the Atal Innovation Mission by NITI Aayog that a system should be prepared in the whole country by this MK Innovation Experiment Entrepreneurship This is a series and the possibility of new employment.Even if we want to prepare a generation invator, then our hair will have to be associated with it and hence the Government of India will talk about it, for that, the government has thought towards giving a huge amount of Rs 10 crore, thus this way India is struggling with many problems, we have seen the problem in everyday life, now we will read to find technology and solution. We have called upon the young generation of Atal Grand Challenge country that you have seen the problem, find research through technology to solve researchDo innovation and brought the Indian government to promote technology discovered to solve our problems and I am happy that people are interested in these buttons, I am confident for the Institutes Incubation Center True Tribute Research Innovation to Abdul Kalam ji, Technology to solve our daily life problems, simplification to get rid of our difficulties will reduce it as much as our new generation will contribute to the modern India of the 21st saree and the same Abdul Kalam jiThere will be a true tribute to my love countrymen, some time ago, we were worrying about time and there is also the pleasure of these two rains, so the news of floods has also been coming, because our full Aarti activity rains in the focal point of activity. Sometimes there is such a disease A caste is a caste, if tourism stays at night, then the way to save it is also a little cleanliness and try to stay safe and pay special attention to the children and this is the thinking that is in the poor settlement itselfSuch a disease has occurred, how is the dengue not like this, dengue comes first in the prosperity area and that's why we understand it, you must see it on TV, but sometimes we are a little indifferent in relation to the awakened action on it.Will reduce ourselves but we too in our house You will not enter your family in the area and do not enter any disease caused by water, I will pray to you, I will not pray for myself, if there is insurance, then the mother does it, the mother does quickThat is why anyone takes antibiotics and gives lentils in the body immediately, but my love countrymen are the paths. It is a habit of taking antibiotics while walking.Get it but after the doctor's advice Let us take antibiotics band. Doctors do not give it until we write it, we do not go to this shortcut from the middle of the shortcut because it is causing a new difficulties because the patient gets the then benefits to use the antibiotic use.But its bacteria become the beginning of these medicines and then the medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria, and then fighting this fight is to make new medicines. The scientist has asked to take as many days to take as many days. Complete the course.Even if you left that creature If you take more than the requirement, you will go in the benefit of the bacterium, and so it is equally important to complete the street courses of the day, so it is healthy, so now if we do not do it, then if we did it, we have done it now.So it goes to the benefit of the bacteria and the bacterium becomes powerful that is bacterial TV and malaria flette, they are bringing such changes in them at a fast pace that medicines have no effect.And so how to use antibiotics It is equally important to follow the rules.I want to add also to add, the concern of the lives of the mothers in our country sometimes hurts a lot in our country, every year about three crore women do pregnancy, but some mothers kill at the time of presentation, sometimes they kill the mother, sometimes the mother kills sometimes the child diesIs it ever Both luck and mother die. It is fine. It is fine in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the fear of untimely death of the mother, but still in a very big mantra, the life of a pregnant mother does not get a child's life, during pregnancy or later blood loss infectionWhen IBP N Jaan destroys his life, keeping in mind this button, the Government of India has launched a new campaign from the last few MeenaNis in government health canto A free check will be done, without the expense of a single penny, in government hospitals, on the 9th of every month, I will urge every poor families to take advantage of this service on the 9th so that to reach the ninth month, ifIf there is any problem, then it can be measured in advance, the lives of both mother and child can be saved and I special to the gynecologist, can you not give this service for the poor mother for the poor mother on a day, one day a monthMy doctor siblings 12 days in a year poor For this low, you can not put the last two, why have you written chities to me, there are doctors from thousands who have taken my words ahead, but India is as big as India, millions of doctors should join this campaign, I believe you are confident youMy love countrymen will definitely join the whole world climate change global warming environment. It is a big discussion in the country and the world, it is discussed collectively in India, in India, these buttons have been given hair on these buttons for centuries, Lord Krishna has been given in the battlefield of Kurukshetra even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra Discuss the tree, to worry in the battlefield in the battlefield, it means that it is important and their children should be followed by our scripture Gita, Shukracharya should be the discipline of Mahabharata, but in today's generation there are some people who are these ideals alsoIt has been shown to be seen a few days ago, I came to my attention an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, I got my mother, according to Mahabharata, in the hereafter, Sonal fulfills the responsibility of children in the hereafterLike a big Has picked up Khandu Maruti Mahare, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka, Pune in Maharashtra, he married his granddaughter Sonal in a big inspiring manner, what did better ji do, all the relatives of the relatives of the guests who came to Sonal's weddingThe plant was presented as a gift and when I had a good picture on social media, it was Mehran that the plants were not seen in the wedding, the plants were looking at the plant, the scene of the mother was in the picture, Sonal who in the picture wasThis is an agricultural graduate Idea came to this and see how the love of mango plants in marriage appeared in a good way, in a way Sonal's marriage became the immortal story of nature, I and Mr. Maitri ji for this innovative effort,I wish a lot of best wishes and many people do such experiments.Will plant and tell them The prasad of the mother's mother is going to bless this plant by going to her village home and blessing the mother.He cultivates timber in place of floods, today, to make India a house, one has to bring urban carbon timber from abroad if we plant such trees on the banks of our farm that furniture and homes come in low, 15 20After the year, you can also cat the government's permission. You and it can also become a new means of your eye and can also back by importing timber to India. Many states have launched a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has also passed a Tempo law still.More than 40000 crore states have life for this Karan plantation.Rajasthan will create a life movement Omumi has done such a big Van Mahotsav and has resolved to plant 25 lakh saplings, there is no small thing in Rajasthan, who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big Andhra Pradesh has also raised its green by 20-29.It has been decided to increase 50%. The Central Government which is running the Green India Mission, under this, the Railways has raised this low, in Gujarat too, there is a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav. God has raised the Lord Gujarat Projects as Van Mahotsav and croresI have run a campaign to plant trees I am not mentioning, but there are letters of congratulations, my love countrymen, both of them have got the opportunity of South Africa life that I was the first journey and if it is a foreign trip, then diplomacy is done. There are talks of trade. There are discussions about security.There are many movies, this is bound to happen, but for me the journey to South Africa was a kind of pilgrimage when remembering South Africa, then it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.When on the ear If you want to read, Gandhi and Mandela showed their faces in front of us, my South Africa tour went to Finix Settlement, Mahatma Gandhi's residence is known as Sarvodaya.I had opened the idea of making a Mahatma a Mahatma Gandhi, Peter Marriage Workstation will also get good luck to him, but what I want to tell, I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities this time who gave up for social opportunity for general. Pani Jawani Khapa had been torn to shoulder to shoulder Malakar with Nelson Mandela.Even after doing such a big penance on his face, it was not visible even on the story of Pan Banna, a kind of duty in the Gita, the symptom of duty, not very true, my mother always saw that meeting, my mother always met that meeting.It will be remembered that general and society opportunity There can be no mantra bigger for the state and the government, and Manu Bhava is the way that we want to get a bright future and we all want a better life, the good future of children is definitely the message of everyone, they have given me a message and worrying about themIt is very natural. They have made me aware of an incident. Now from Bangalore, I had read the article in a news a few days ago that a woman earned an eye in the fraud of fraud seat email and he committed suicide by committing suicide.I regret her family I would like to know what your idea is in the big of such cheat of email, you must also have come to the attention that sometimes we get to the people on our email on our mobile phone, some message that you have been rewarded for so much moneyGive so much money and take so much money and some people get confused as fans are fans in the mouth that Vishwakarma is failing a new way of robbing from the middle of the technology and like technology is playing a big role in the economic system, then itsThe misuse also goes to the field The daughter had to be married and also had to build a house. One day she came to an SMS that a valuable gift has come from abroad for them to deposit 2 lakh rupees in a bank account for them and without this gentlemanThink of some thoughts, I have understood by extracting two lakh rupees from my life's hard earned money and he has to write a letter as well as it seems that you have the right letter, make any fake letter post and send your credit cardNumber takes the debit card number and from the middle of technology The account becomes empty, it is a fraud of the new way.

You must have seen this international yoga last week.For the sake of Pav, the postage stamp of Surya Namaskar has also been released, this time, along with yoga in the world, special attention has been made on two things, social media has become an identity of social media and this time in yoga, Twitter has given yoga emoji in yogaA light use of celebrations with Also did it as soon as he tied the hishtag yoga, the picture of yoga emoji used to be on our mobile phone and he became popular all over the world, Swami Srivastava telephone me after this yoga day and he gave me a message after this yoga day.It is for all of you but it seems probably he is more for me, that is why I want every serial in Doordarshan, the more we want our whole India country, Swamiji is good, but if you see a little carefully, then yourCare will not only come in gravity in Once India and India are giving their contribution in the promotion of yoga every day in the world of TV media and all the TV channels of the world are contributing different times, but if you look carefully, then you will see information about yoga.All this is happening and I have seen that there are some countries in the world where the channel dedicated to yoga 24 hours also runs and you will know that I will be able to every day between Twitter and Facebook every day in the month of June.On the day a video of a new posture lion, if you do Ayush Mantra If you go to the website of rhythm, then what kind of yoga can be done for different organs of the body one after the other for 40-45 minutes.You will also say to you and from you to all the qualified curiosities that they are associated with it that when we say that yoga is the middle of liberation, then why all the school of thoughts we all have together in relation to yoga.I have different experiences but everyone's final goal is one as many types of yo C's genres are going on as many types of yoga are going on, all the types of yoga gurus, I have urged that we have all urged that this year can run a successful campaign against diabetes by Yogi against diabetes.Diabetes can be controlled.That all the rest of the path Does not go, he becomes an entrance to Indian diseases and hence everyone wants to protect against diabetes. Many people have also reduced in this direction.Do a lion too, give it a momentum. Create an atmosphere throughout the year. I urge you to do the hashtag yoga fights diabetes.towards It is committed but today when I am talking to you on 26th June, I want to tell the new generation especially that we are proud of democracy, democracy has given us a great strength to every citizen, but has given us great power but 26 June1975 It was also a day on the night of 25 June and the morning of 26 June. What was the black night for the democracy of India, the emergency implemented in India, all the rights of the citizens were abolished, the country was made Jai food, Jai Prakash was made Jai PrakashMillions of people of the country including Narayan got thousands of leaders He has been pushed behind Jai's bars, he has written many books on the fierce black incident, but today I am talking to you on 26 June, then we do not forget that our strength is democracy, our strength is our strengthShakti is our strength. Our strength is a citizen, we have to pursue this commitment and make it powerful and it is the strength of the people of India that they have shown democracy, they have shown the newspapers on the newspapers.The people introduce democratic powers only to read the opportunity Get these things a form of great power for a country, it is a good example of the democratic strength of the general human being and that introduction of democratic strength, the country should keep remembering the country again and again and should keep realizing the power of the people and people should keep realizingShakti should get hair in every way, we should have a tendency and people should join, I always say that brother democracy does not mean that people should vote and give you a contract to walk the country for 5 years, do not voteDoing an important importance of democracy There is a lot of aspects but there are many other aspects and the biggest aspect is that the people's thinking and the more people are more connected with the public, the more the strength of the country is to increase, our waste has given hair to our waste.When 2 years of my government were completed, some modern -minded youth suggested me, do you talk about such a big democracy, so why not get your government evaluated to the people, in the same way, their challenge was the only tone of the suggestion.There was also a voice but he of my mother I gave up some of my senior colleagues, I am happy that when I used different speeches from the middle of technology to evaluate my government to the public to evaluate my government even after the election, there are many surveys.Surveys are done, sometimes survey is done on some issues in the middle, there are survey on popularity, but its sample size is not much. Many of you have given their opinion on the government at the rate, although millions of people show interest in it but3 lakh people have a question Has worked hard to answer, I am very grateful to those three lakh people, they will definitely do the media but it was a good experiment, so I will definitely say and it is a matter of happiness for me that all the speeches of India's speechesPeople with every type of background living in every corner who speaks participated in it and the biggest is the surprise for me that the Government of India's scheme of rural employment, the website of the scheme, the website of the scheme is the highest on the portalFloods and took part of it Meaning that people associated with poverty associated with rural life take a very active yogadantay time, I liked it more, it was more good, so it was also a day when the voice of the public was given on 26 June a few years ago andIt is also the time that when the public itself does it, the government is correcting the right government that he is doing wrong, it is doing good, this is the strength of democracy, my love countrymen today I am a special request for one thing.I want to do tax evasion in tax. In the understanding of bringing things abroad, there were many restrictions, so smuggling used to flood the same, but gradually time has changed, now it is not less difficult to connect the tax data with the tax system of the government, but still the old habits are not casteIt is a generation to still feel that today I want to urge you that by participating with the rules, we can bother us, why should we always be the government in relation to our property in relation to our own wealth.Special facility to the country It is a matter of paying that we can be free from many types of burden by paying penalty. I have also promised that the government will voluntarily give its information to the government regarding the declared money, then the government is not an inquiry if there is any kind of investigation.Where will this money come from, how did it come from, not even once and so I say that there is a good opportunity that you become a part of a transparent system, I also told our MPs in the middle that after 30 September, if a citizenThere should be trouble that does not want to connect with government rules If it is possible, they will not be able to help them, I also want to tell the countrymen that after September 30, there is anything like you have any problem, so I say it will be good that before September 30, you should take advantage of this system andAfter September 30, take the child from the possible problems, my countrymen had to talk about my mother, because now I have to trust our revival department income, the thief en man, trust us citizens, we have to change from our conduct.Tax legs will have to assure me With a lot of request, he has told these buttons to them and I was seeing them that when the country is flooding ahead today, we should contribute and when I was taking information in this knowledge confluence, I was taking a informationYou also want to tell you that taxable income is more than 50 lakhs. It is not going to hug anyone, people with more than 50 lakh taxable income are seen in millions in big lions.It is learned how it can be less than 50 lakhs in dare. There is a mess to change the situation and change before September 30, the government should give an opportunity to Janardan before lifting any harsh low and hence my love brothers and sisters are a golden opportunity to declare the sisters, second way on 30th September.There is a way to get rid of the crisis caused by later crises, I urge you to come to this low for the welfare of the country for the good of the country and I do not want you to have any problem after September 23, my love countrymen.A lot for the general human country of the country It is relieved to find an opportunity to do when I told people to leave the subsidy of LPG, more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily left the most, I want to do it, I want to do it, I wantThere I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Chandrakant Damodar Kulkarni and his family members.

W8Fow2P92Tw,"PM Modi's Mann Ki Baat, May 2016  | Mann ki Baat 20th Episode",https://youtube.com/watch?v=W8Fow2P92Tw,2016-05-21,"My love countrymen Hello once again, today I have got an opportunity to talk about mother, I am not a ritual of mother. I myself am very keen to talk to you and I am happy that mother in every corner of IndiaFrom the middle of the button but the common people of the country, I know that I am also grateful to Akashvani, he has made a successful attempt to present this mother in the regional speech at 8:00 pm and I tooGlad that people who listen to me many things The government helps in the low government. How active should the government be.How to go on to democracy, we will definitely say that the heat is going on to increase, they used to hope that there will be some shortage, but the experience has come to increase in the middle, there is also news in the middle that perhaps the monsoon will delay for 1 week, then there was anxiety and flooding.Nearly the maximum part of the country is feeling the scorching heat of the heat today It is only due to environment, the problem is going to increase, the forests have been reduced by sitting, and in the way, mankind has destroyed nature and made the path of destruction of itself.Discussions are done for the environment. There is anxiety. This time the United Nations has put the topic of World Environment Day trade, the previous two Uttarakhand Himachal Negligence is increased, then it is a very big caste in a very big caste and hence saving the forests is to save water, it becomes the responsibility of all of us to protect the forests.Caste The previous two have been the opportunity to talk in detail with the Chief Minister of 11 states in which I have more happiness in the last two states, Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan, Maharashtra Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh Jharkhand Karnataka Andhra Pradesh Telangana, Telangana Orissa, the way the government has been the tradition of the government.All the pleasures could have held a meeting of the affected states, but I did not do this. It is not more closely talked about by going from and how many people were spent.For humans for animals, why should there not be any pulses government in every corner of the whole country and it was experienced that what happened to permanent solutions to deal with the long -term situation of this problem.Andhra has given Gujarat a lot of technology I have done yoga, I would like to bring these special successful efforts of the states by NITI Aayog in front of us and to the states as well, life participation in solving such problems is the basis of a great success and if there is perfect planning in it, proper technologyUse and efforts to complete the arrangements within the time limit can be found, my faith can be found that there is a prasad of God about water conservation about management, as if you go to the temple, give some offerings and a little falls a little bit.So There is a thief in the mother, he picks him up and demands BJP's apology 5 times, this water is also a prasad of God, even if a drop is ruined, we should be pained and hence water storage is equally important, water conservation is equally important.It is the same importance that water irrigation is equally important and that is why the crop caused by the drop peacock micro irrigation at least water is now a matter of happiness that in many states, farmers of our songs are also using micro education.Someone is using drip irrigation If I sit with the states, some states have also used successful cocations for the cultivation of rice even for lying and their yield has also been reduced by the child and wages that have also reduced their yield.Large targets have been taken, especially Maharashtra Andhra and Gujarat, three states have reduced very big in drip irrigation and their effort is that every year two to three lakh hectares of microwave, if this campaign has run in all the states, then farming is also done.There will also be a lot of benefit, there will also be accumulation of water The brothers of Telangana have tried to use the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi. Andhra Pradesh has also used technology in Neeru Pragati Mission.It is also outside, Jaluk Camp campaign is also giving money to save Maharashtra from future crisis, I experience Chhattisgarh who has run Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan, Madhya Pradesh has given Balram Talab Yojana about 22000 locks. These are not small figures. Thus, their Kapil Hader Scheme has been less resting in the direction of rebuilding the Chief Minister's Jal Bachao Abhiyan from Uttar Pradesh in the form of Kalyani Yojana in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat where there are more old -fashioned Bavaria.A major campaign has been launched to revive it as a water temple, Rajasthan has launched a campaign to stop the water, Chief Minister Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan has been launched to stop the water. On July July, September, September, we will not be wasted even a drop of water will be wasted.We fulfill it, but if we are careless after seeing a lot of water, Jain and when the water season is over, how can it be disturbed without water and this time when we celebrate Diwali, then enjoy it tooHow much water we have saved how much water rock, now see our happiness If there will be a strength in the water will be flood manifold, how many we have come to sprinkle a little water on the mouth, so how many are fresh, now how many have gone, but how long have you gone, but see a huge simple lake or see the ocean water, what kind of vastExperience is what a precious treasure is, God has given it, Jain Jain should survey her.Do not die for the coming 4 months for the drop of water It has to be converted into water saving campaign, not the leaders, this life is less. The media has given a pot in the last two water troubles, I hope that the media guide the people towards saving water and run the campaign and waterMedia became partners for the freedom of the crisis, I also invite them, my love countrymen have to make modern India. Old habits will also have to change a little bit, if you help me, we can successfully flood it forward in the direction. We all know that we used to be impressed in school when there were no coins, there was notifications that there was a notification that if you want vegetables, thenGive so many wheat in return, you want salt, then give vegetables in return, the water system was going right, the currency started slowly, no one started coming, coins started coming, but now the time has been cloudy, the whole world has been cloudy towards the cashless society.Electronic technology is flooding ahead The start starting will look a bit difficult but once it is used to habit, then this system will be simple, now it is likely that both of them who launched the campaign of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana opened the bank account of almost all the families of the country, on the other hand, the Aadhaar number was also found on the other side.And mobiles have reached the hands of every Hindustani of India almost, then we can flood towards this cashless society while doing Jan Dhan Aadhaar and mobile.You should be a rupee card to anyone If you want to pay, then you can give it when there is no need to count the money from it, there is no need to visit the lake, how to pay a pose in it, how to pay money, Jain, Jain, we have started the second low bank on mobile universal paymentInterface banking transaction will change the UPI method and it will be very easy to make money transactions through your mobile phone and it is a matter of pleasure that NPCI and banks are reducing this platform to launch the mobile up and if it happenedSo maybe you even pay money Togetar, there will be no need to be there in the country as almost banking correspondence, youth have been Bharati. In a way, the bank has reduced it in the direction by you, the post office has also been decorated for banking services.If we teach to use the arrangements and put Aadhaar, then we will not be able to get the notes, then the money will not be lost, then I will urge the countrymen that we start, we should see it onceIf you start then very easily We will move forward 20 years ago who thought that so many mobiles went to their own gradually, now it can not be done without it, this cashless society can also be done in the same form but if it is in a short time, then it will be in a short timeIt would be better my love countrymen whenever the game of Olympics comes and when the game started, then we are sitting with Sir Pathak, we have a lot of gold medal challenges, but the atmosphere in the country should be Banna Banna to encourage our players with life for Riya Olympics.Everyone has their own ways to raise the encouragement A cartoon written by a song from a song and when I talk, I also got my mother, Mr. Sarmanand Sonowal, for a lesser, I want to tell you that we all will come to Assam for the results of the wrong week elections.Will the letters result in the results and Siman Sarmanand ji himself was leading the election of Assam, but he was also a minister of the Government of India and when I got this information, it was very happy that he was very happy that he was the result of the Assam election resultsBefore telling anyone before, he reached Patiala Jab Netaji Subhash National Institute of Bharat NIOS where our players with life in Olympics are trained that a minister should worry so much in this way, what is the system of food, what is the system of food, the system is not available or not getting the nutrition food as per the requirement.Is it the required trainer for their body is the train or not, all the machines of the training are going well or not, they are closely good, and went to the room of each player and saw the players in detail. Talked to the management and talked to the trainer, he himself eaten food with all the players, the election results are going to be good, the Chief Minister's night is good, but even if one of my fellow sports ministers should worry about this low vision as the minister.So I am happy and I believe that we all understand the importance of the game. Encourage the people of the game.The courage gets elevated to me Suggestions came from all over the country and I have seen that an environment of football has started appearing in the country, Narendra Modi may have received thousands of suggestions on mobile ups, many people will not play but thousands of youths of the country are so interested in the game.It was a pleasant experience for me in itself, then we know cricket and India, but I have seen so much in football, it indicates a very pleasant future in itself, so all our prayers for Riya Olympics for the OlympicsWe have a joy towards the players There was an atmosphere of enthusiasm and not to win everything in both of them, India should make a mark in the world with India that we should do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and enthusiasm towards the colleagues associated with our sports world.For the last 8-10 days, Kahani Kahani Result A has been talking, I am not talking about the result of the election, I am talking about the students who have started the result of the tent of the year, one result has started coming after the Twelfth Twelfth.So it is clear that our daughters are showing their might It is a matter of Shri, my best wishes to those who have been successful in these results, Gaurav Patel, he has presented a big difficulty before me that Gaurav Patel has been that I have got 89.33% in the board exam of MP, so this postI felt what is the happiness there, but further he has been the story of his grief, Gaurav Patel is that when I reached home with 89.33% mark, I was thinking that I will get congratulations from all around butI was defeat That is, my family and my friend, my teacher, no one was a question about my 89.33% kill, everyone was doing my 90% for me, I am not understanding how I have a handle in such a situationDo everything in life, what is it that what I did was not good, I also did not know some lesser, I do not know my mother, I have read your letter very carefully and I think maybeThis pain is not yours, millions of crore students like you will be there because one A similar atmosphere has been created that it is another form of negativity to find satisfaction from what has happened to what has happened, we can never take the society in the direction of satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from everything. Your family members can never take the society towards satisfaction.If friends had all your 89.33%, then you would have done the mother to do something more on their own, I urge the parents that your children have come like the results, accept it and welcome him and express it.Encouraged to carry forward A. Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur has also written to me, almost like this, he says that the people around them are not accepting our results, they say that they do something better and do something better, I do not remember the poem Puri Puri.But I was lying long ago, a poet wrote that I made a picture of the anguish on the canvas of my life and when there was an exhibition, everyone said that there is definitely a touchup, someone used to say that if there was yellow due to blueUsed to say that it would have been good if this line had been there at the same time I wish even a solitary philosophy on the picture of this pain of mine has shed tears, this was the words of the poem, I do not remember it now, but it is a long time ago, but the feeling was that he could not understand any of the pictures from the picture.Everyone was talking about touching, Santosh Giri ji, your worry is the same as it is proud and you will be a crores of students like you to fulfill the expectations of the people, I am very angry with you, I will tell you so much that in such a situation youDon't lose your balance, everyone expresses expectation, keep listening Who has been dated on its own and keep trying to do something better, but if you do not get satisfactory, then the new building will never be able to build the strong sleep of success is the basis of great success.Dissatisfaction has not been made directly, knowing that it becomes a guarantee of failure and hence I will urge you that the success that has been achieved will create new success from this, but this thing will arise from the neighborhood every day and mother you and friendsI want to say more than your children Please do not expect your expectations on them and friends, if they are sometimes failed in life, is that life is a caste, is that one who can never bring Akshay Kumar in the exam, he is taken far ahead in India.It is the artist, open it on it, you will be taken forward and it is everywhere in life.Who put his hand and today one of the world Clean shehnai made a half -hearted instrument. Most of the courts of King Maharajas were on the gate of the shehnai.It has become an identity of it and so what is you worried, leave worry about it.He is a track of life It makes it feel right, it is right that the cost of being insurance is very low, but after getting insurance, the cost of getting healthy is very high, why should we not live such a life so that the disease does not come, there is no financial burden on the family.The biggest basis for protecting from cleanliness disease is the biggest service of the poor, if anyone can do, then there is cleanliness and another, for which I constantly urge, some people also call him Yoga. 21 June is on June 21 International Yoga Day is in the whole worldThere is also attraction towards yoga, there is also reverence And the world has accepted this by our ancestors, we have given us a precious gift that we have given to the world, the strength to live a balanced life, gives yoga to live a balanced life.Being rich in will power with unmatched confidence India is a concentration in every low.Eat for yoga and e On 21 June Yoga Day inspires us and sometimes the collective environment is to make changes in the life of a person, you will go to the website of the Government of India, then the syllabus of yoga is the syllabus this timeStart a month in a way.Is environmental cloud to use 21 June We can do yoga in our life to bring yoga in our society life.

He has put a big sensitive issue for all of us. He said that the milk sellers come near our house, the newspapers come. Postmen come.Do we ever pass They have asked them for water during the summer days. Have we ever offered water to him, I am very grateful to you in Shilpa.If the postman came near the house and we would like water, how good it would be in India, it is in India, but Shilpa is grateful that you have bored these things, my dear farmer brothers and sisters, Digital India Digital India, you must have heard a lotDoes think that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city, no you will be happy that you have presented a farmer facility in the service of all of you, if you download it in your mobile phone through the Kisan Suvidha app, then a lot of agriculture related weather related to youInformation will be found in your palm itself, what is the condition of the market, what is the situation in the mandis.Straight you directly with agricultural scientists It adds the expert and connects with the expert and if you put any question in front of him, then he answers, I hope that my farmer siblings download this farmer facility app on your mobile phone and try it in itWhat is useful for you, and if you feel something missing, then you also complain to my farmer brothers and sisters, there is an opportunity for the heat holidays, but it becomes an opportunity for the farmer to sweat moreHe wait for rain and before waiting The farmer gets connected to life to prepare his farm so that he does not want to allow even a drop of rain to be wasted. For the farming, it is very important for the farming before the beginning of the farming season, but we countrymen also thinkWhat will happen without water, is this time we lock our way of water flowing in the ponds, where garbage or some ankroachment is done, then the water stops coming and itsThe reason is gradually decreasing Whether we can dig those old places once again and prepare for more water harvesting by cleaning, if we save the water, if the water is saved even in the first rain, our river drains are filled, then sometimes the rain root backEven if we go, our loss is reduced, this time you must have seen that five lakh ponds have taken the pond to build a pond, I have also emphasized on the MNREGA to create assets for water harvestSave the water of the village, how to run this campaign in the village You plan to join the government's schemes so that the Mahatma of which the Mahatma is also understood and everyone will have many such villages in the country for the accumulation of water, there will be many progressive farmers who will have many aware citizens who did this work.It will happen but still there is a need to do more more my farmer brothers and sisters, I want to repeat again today because the Government of India had organized a very big farmer fair recently and I saw whether modern technology has come and how muchChanged There is an agriculture sector but still to reach the fields and now the farmer has also started saying that brother now, I welcome it, I welcome it, the misuse of more fertilizer has made our mother sick and we have made this earth sick and we earthMother's son is a child.Isn't it so much of the fertilizer Why should not the best fert be, but if we use it too much, then they will become the cause of ruin, everything should be balanced and it will also reduce the cost will save you and our opinion will be less than that less cost is more output less cost moreWe should walk and in scientific ways we should pursue our agriculture, I hope that whatever necessary work we have to do in water harvesting, we have one or two months till the rain comes, we should do it with full enthusiasm as much as the water will be saved to the farming.Life will be as much as possible My dear countrymen will survive on April 7, and this time the world has focused on World Health Day on this theme. Diabetes is to defeat diabetes. Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.Once diabetes enters, guests like a lot of disease enter their house. In 2014, there were about 65 crore diabetes patients in India.There are two types of There is a type of type two type one in the dynasty in the past, the head is to the parents, so the child is there and due to the type two habits, we invite him to invite him due to obesity due to age, the world is worried about diabetes, thereforeOn the 7th, it has been a theme in World Health Day. We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest reason for it is the physical labor is decreasing. There is no sign of sweat, there is no markAre nothing happening offline from 7th date Taking some inspiration that you can do something to defeat diabetes in your personal life, can you be interested in yoga, then do yoga or else go to run at least to run, so if every citizen of my country will be healthy then my India too will be healthySo it will be healthy, sometimes we do not get an inhibited medical check up and then after getting very bad condition, I would come to meditation, I had very old diabetes, what goes into checking, do so much and now all things are available very easilyYou must be worried about 24 The world made TB Day when I was young, I used to get scared on hearing the name of the TV, it seemed that now death has come but now TV is not afraid because everyone knows that TV can be treated and can be treated andIt can be easily but when TV and death were added, we were afraid, but now we have become careless towards TV, compared to the world, we have a lot of TBShould and should be complete treatment and complete treatment and complete treatment If given, it causes trouble, good TB is such a thing that people of the neighborhood can also decide, brother, check, check you, you have become a TV, there is a lot of fever, there is a fever, then the weight starts to lose weight, then the weight starts to be reduced, then the weight startsThe neighborhood would also know that look, he has not been TB B, it means that this disease is such that which can be investigated soon, my dear countrymen are doing a lot of work in this direction, there is more than 13500 microscope centers.There are more than four lakh dot provider and all the services are free You are in the presence, you can get it checked once and this disease can go, just the treatment and treatment continues till the disease is destroyed. Whether it is TB or diabetes, we have to defeat it, India has to defeat it with these diseases.It is to be liberated, but this government does not belong to doctor medicine unless you do and so I urge my countrymen today to get rid of diabetes, get rid of TB, my dear countrymen are coming to many important opportunities in the month of April.Especially 14 April Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birthday 125 and Jubilee, a Panchtirtha Mau, who was celebrated in the whole country throughout the year, his birth place was his education in London.We are constantly trying for the development of these five pilgrimages, I am a privilege that I am getting the privilege of going to Mau, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14 April this year, Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a good citizen.Have given that path By becoming a good citizen by walking, we can pay a lot of tribute to them, in a few days, Vikram Samvat will begin, the new Vikram Samvat will come in different states.Gudi Padwa says some year Pratipada says that someone says Ugad, but it is great in all areas of India.You can hear anytime 2 to listen to 2 You can hear in 0 languages you can hear on your own time.People took advantage of this, you also write number 8108 8108 I repeat 8108 8108 You make a miss and whenever you want to hear the old mind, you can even hear you in your own languageMy dear countrymen will be very much to be connected with you Best wishes a lot [music] [praise] [music] [praise] [music] thanks"

Thank you very much and you are reducing yourself in the field, you understand these buttons like a spear and you have a lot of difficulty now Lee will be sometimes an opportunity to meet such a person in the society, then our mother comes late sari thoughts. According to our thinking, we also express our view of seeing it. There are many people who are victims of accidentsKaran gives their own organ villages, some people are that there is a damage and a caste for such people and many words have been used in the world, but always thinking about these words is also being contemplated to people all the time.It does not like the identity of the word for them respectable It does not seem and we must have seen that so many words have been heard, sometimes he used to listen to the words handicap, sometimes all were enemies, sometimes many words are coming the day after tomorrow, it is true that words also have their own importance when God India when IndiaThe government started the Bharat Abhiyan in Sama, he was going to life in the program but in some districts of Tamil Nadu and especially in Chennai, Karan of fierce India, Karan of India, made a program of life there, I could not get it in the program, but in the programIf I had to go, something in my mother If some thoughts used to go on, then time came to my mother, that the one who has given any deficiency in the body, has given any damage to the body, the airs are not reducing properly, we call it disabled and know it as a disabled.But sometimes we get into their introduction, then it is learned that we see a deficiency from the eyes, but God has given him an extra power, a different power has been represented by God, which we are not with our own eyesYou can see but when you see him reduce it If he goes to pay attention to how he does this, then the idea came to my mother that we may think that he is disabled, but from the experience it seems that he has an extra power extra power and then go and then go and then goI thought in my mother, why do we not use the word Divyang in our country in place of the disabled, who has one organ or more than one organ in which divinity is the communication of divine power which we do not have the normal bodyI have this word very good, is my countrymen habit Neither can you prevail the word Divyang in place of the handicapped, do I hope that you will take this point forward, we have started the Bharat Abhiyan in the day, under this we have started both physical and virtual and both of themI will be built in the school, a government office should be a government office, a bus stand, a ramp should be an accessible parking access, an accessible lift, Bareilly Innovation, Technology should be required. The schemes of the countrymen government are continuously running, but it is very important that the plans should always remain life, the plans should be alive till the last person should be alive, they should not die in the files, after all the scheme is distributed for the poor person for the common person.For the previous two Indian government made an effort that how the benefits of the scheme are easily reached, our country has a subsidy in the gas cylinder, but it was not an account that the beneficiaries who are beneficiaries are reaching it or not.Fifth note of musical scale Hum is reaching the right time, that the government is not reaching, it has made a little change, with the help of Aadhaar card, all of them are reaching the subsidy in the bank account of the beneficiaries directly by Kim, the world's largest largest benefit transfer transfer of the world.I am proud to tell the countrymen that it has just got the place in the Green Book of World Records that it has been the world's largest direct benefit transfer which has been successfully implemented, the first name is prevalent and the Lord is prevalent and GodHas been very successful By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG consumers have become the beneficiaries of the first scheme, in the account of 15 crore people, the government money in the bank account directly knows that there is no possibility of corruption.Opening on the third side, preparing the list of beneficiaries of the state government and the Government of India together and connecting them with the account is going on.But now that Dha money has started to be deposited in the account of a person who works wages. The student had many difficulties in scholarships, there were also complaints, now they have started, they will slowly move forward, so far, about 40 thousand crore rupees straight so far.The beneficiary's account has to know that there is a thick thick from the middle of different schemes, my style is about 35 to 40 schemes, now directly within direct benefit transfer, my love countrymen 26 January 26Pal is also combined in the morning This time, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the creator of our Constitution, his 125th birth anniversary is also a special discussion on the Constitution in the MP for two days and all the pulses are feeling very good.Understanding this very good discussion, we should pursue this thing, Republic Day can combine people in the true sense and can connect the system with people, does our constitution give us a lot of rights and rightsDiscussion of Shahid form It is ti, but the Constitution also gives hair on duty, but it is showing that it is our sacred duty, it is a lot of duty at the time of voting, but why should we talk even in a comfortable life when we are 125th of Babasaheb Ambedkar this year.If we are considering the birth anniversary, then we can make an entry on 26th January in the schools in the college in our village in our city in different-Den Society in our village, can do the essay competition on this subject, Kavya Principal Personality CompetitionPossibility Jain can become a lesser history, but start with discussion, but start with the discussion, then I think in my mother, if you have to write Hindi before my language in your language before 26 January, then you have to write HindiIf you want to write Hindi in English, then you should write such an essay on duty on duty in English, you can send me essay. Can I want to know your thoughts.What to think about Ti is a mother to give a small suggestion on 26th January. When we believe Republic Day, do we have statues of all the great men in our city by the children of the school college by the citizens.Best cleanliness can be best best than January 26Why are you On this 26 January, we all should try together to honor the statues of such great men, clean the cleaning complex and all this by the public Janardhana, the citizens should be easily loved by the citizens, the countrymen again, once again, the late New Year's Sari Sari Sari Sari is very good.Thank you"
crUbQyWPRp0,"PM Modi's Mann Ki Baat, November 2015 | Mann ki Baat 14th Episode",https://youtube.com/watch?v=crUbQyWPRp0,2015-11-28,"Love countrymen Namaste Diwali, you must have made holidays very well during the Pawan Pav of Diwali.Festival is sometimes a festival comes less to fill the village, sometimes the celebrations give new energy, but sometimes Anna may have heard or thought that there are reports of such natural disasters, how fast the effect of climate change is flooding.We are experiencing this There are two types of life in our own country and that too, which has caused the loss in Tamil Nadu due to rain and it also affects the states, I express their condolences to all those families, the state government has fulfilled the relief and playing works by the state government.There are castes connected to the earth, the central government also always reduces shoulder to the shoulder, but I am confident that once the power of Tamil Nadu will be taken forward with a very sharp fall and it will continue to play the role in advancing the country but when it will continue to play but whenThis is all around the crises If we see, then we have needed to bring a lot of change in it 15 years ago, natural disaster used to be part of the Department of Agriculture, because then it is more natural. The period was limited to this, today its cloud has been cloudy at every level.We have become very mandatory to reduce our capacity building. Governments have given civil society to reduce every minor problems for capacity building in a very scientific manner.S Was talked about and I had given a suggestion to him that we should do a joint exercise for the disaster of the SAARC Desh together that I am happy that the SAARC country's table top exercise and the best practice seminar workshop took place in DelhiI have started today, I have got Lakhwinder Singh's phone from Jalandhar in Punjab, I am speaking from district Jalandhar, we do organic farming here and many people also guide in farming, I have a question that it is a question that people to these fieldsToday we put this earth Sham is the bacteria, they are making them so bad and what is happening this pollution, how to get it in Punjab in Delhi, Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message, so did you enjoy this thing, will you do organic farmingFarmers are farmers and do organic farming themselves. Not only this, you understand the problem of who spears and your concern is right but it is only in Punjab Haryana, it is not that it is a habit of us in the whole of India and traditional formFrom we like this to the remains of our crop Let's read on the path of jealousy, one was not the first to do the same.He got involved in it and when the effect of this crisis started coming to the patient and then the pain you have expressed, but the pain you have expressed, it is right, first of all you have come, I have to train our farmer brothers and sisters, they have to be considered to be true.This crop residue will be left due to irritation The hard work will be light, the field will be ready for the next crop, but this is not the truth. The residues of the crop are also very valuable. They have some organic manure in itself, we ruin it, not only that if it is small piecesJains have been done, it becomes a dry fruit for animals, it is water caste. My farmer siblings, think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong.If you go, what will we be able to back alive, will there be a heart proof You will not be able to back alive, as our Chandi Jain of the body becomes difficult to live, in the same way, it is not just looking for it from the burning of the crop, this earth is the Chandi water caste of the mother.The land pushes out to death and so it should make positive efforts, even if it is caught in the ground once again, it becomes a manure or if a mattress is delayed in a mattress and put a little water, then the best typeOrganic manure is made and a less of animal food comes Shri comes and our land is left, not only that, it is prepared in the ground, then it gives double benefit.Earlier, when he used to cultivate banana and when banana crop was finished, sometimes he had to spend 5000 10000 15000 rupees per hectare to clean the foot of banana and until the people who raise it.Till then he did not bring the tractor, it was a relief to stand like this but some Who used it, cut it into 668 inches of foot of the foot and if it was created in the ground, then the experience of this banana also has so much water that where it is given to it, if there is a tree there, there is a plant then there is a crop, then there is a crop, then there is a crop then there is a crop.For 3 months, there is no need for water outside the water, the water that is in the spit is to keep the crop alive and today they have become very valuable, they have started coming from their feet, which cost the cost of cleaning the first cold.I had to do today, how much a small experiment can be made by searching for the demand post. This is not less than any scientist, our farmer brother, first of all, on December 3, the International De of Person's Disability will remember the whole world. Last time, I had discussed the mother of the organ donation. I also discussed the helpline of notes for organ donation.Discuss and I was told that after talking to her mother, phone calls increased by about 7 * and two and a half times increased on the website. On November 27, Indian Ang Donation was celebrated as given as Indian Ang Donation.Film actress Raveena Tand Kar Many well -known people, including the body, can get a child related to organ donation, valuable life, the organ donation is taken in a way, which is taken from one body to another, then the organ gets new life but he gets new life in lifeMill is a caste, what can be the biggest wealth than this, a national registry of Arjun transplantation waiting for the transmitter has been launched on 27 November.Competition was rakhi and for me It was surprising that so many people took so much participation in such innovative and tell them with great condolences.Shakti does not make any donations as if I told earlier December 3 is celebrated as a handicap dayGets sometimes A sense of compassion and kind is revealed, but if we change our vision change, these people can inspire us to live and inspire to do something, we can inspire you to do something, even if we are small, then even if you go, then for the run, then for the runI sit down, remember that my crisis is very small, how does it pass how it reduces and hence all this is a source of inspiration for us, their determination power is their way of struggling with life and also the crisis and crisisHis luck to convert into capable is Javed A Hamad today wants to tell him 40 42 years old. 1996 In Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was killed by terrorists by terrorists, but went back but went back but the terrorists shot Karan kidney gawdi intestine and a part of the hand to a part of the hand.Serious Nature became the final injury, the capable of standing on his feet went away forever, but Javed Ahmed did not even hurt money terrorism, and did not even bother them and P is how to improve these fast sectors for physically handicapped people.Public place They are reducing how to develop arrangements for the disabled in offices, but they are also reducing their studies in this direction. He took a master's degree in social and as a social worker, as a mosque of a conscious citizen's knight disabled.K Bass is doing a silent revolution. Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India, do I miss Javed Ahmed's life and his dedication on December 3, especially on December 3Our country has been so much There is a lot of things, there are many things in which we are dependents on the governments, the person of the middle class should be a person from the lower middle, the poor are poor, the Dalit victims are deprived of exploitation, for them, there is a continuous relationship with the government with the government and the night life of a citizenI have come to a big experience from some government babu at some time, and we have a government system throughout my life that there is a network in our country in our country, there is a network in the whole country of Asha worker, we sometimes among the people of India among the people of IndiaNever discuss about Asha worker I will be Sunny Hai na you, but when I have become a missle in the world as the world famous family Entrepreneur of Bill Gate Foundation, we have given joint Padma Bhushan to both such Bill Gates and Milind Gates.Let's do their own retirement time and whatever you have earned in lifetime, they are expecting to reduce them, they have got the opportunity to reduce them, they praise them so much and they have so much to eatWhat is this hope worker Dedication is so hard work, how much enthusiasm is there for new learning, these saris want both Orissa Government. A special honor of a Asha worker on Independence Day, a small village in Baleshwar district of OrissaAnd according to the saree population schedule Tribe there, there are people from tribal that there are poverty and there is an area affected by malaria and there is an Asha worker of this village Jamuna Mani Singh, he took place, did I hold no one from malaria in this village.I will give you home Go to the news of all the small fever, go for its basic treatment. Use every household insecticide mosquito net, to give it hair on it as if your own child sleeps properly and loves as much as you should love the gender, the whole village remains from the mosquitoes to the back to the back.They continue to reduce the dedication of the dedication and he competed with malaria. How many millions of people would have been prepared to compete with the entire villageWhat a big force of our country would become How do I become a great companion of the happiness and sorrow of society, I make all such ASHA works proud from the middle of Jamuna Money.Regarding health in relation to health, I urge you, you see it, not only to show it to others and maybe what you do to add such things to you, then definitely give such a thing that such a thing is that it is such that very soonIt has not come to our attention but the same of society is right Strength is positive power is the greatest energy.This happened here, there can be a teacher, I invite you to come in national construction. My love countrymen are worried about the whole world climate change. Climate change is being approved as global warming. One of the first way to save from knowledge is Energy Savings Energy Conservation 14 December National Energy Conservation Day is many schemes are going on by the government LED bulb is going on. I once said that the street light band on the full moon nightOne should take a bath in the light of full moon for an hour by doing darkness and you should experience the light of the moon, a friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, then the mother went to tell me that I should tell you tooCredit to Zee News Gujarati promotion It has been formed a committee of women and solar energy -powered lantern has set up a plant of it and she gives the lantern with a month of ₹ 100.And in a very big mantra, I have heard that 500 people come to 500 houses.

The economy is going on, although I want to go at the pace of speed, that pace is yet to be honey, but the beginning has been good, in such a short time, about 66 lakh people and most of the help to their Saint OBC are people of this class who themselvesBy working hard and trying to walk the family with respect on his feet, Abhishek has told himself about his enthusiasm, I also have a lot of news, someone also told that someone has done some Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai, he has a Mudra YojanaUnder the bank, they get a loan of 8:30 lakhs And he started the business of Shivage dress cleaning.From ₹ 40000, she is reduced to make buttwa and make wallets, but earlier she used to bring more money from more bass and used to do business with great difficulty, now she used to get money together in a good mantra.See it well and Harale, who used to spend more than the additional bass and the law, both of them did not get more than ₹ 1000 more Bachchan every month and their family also got a good business slowly on his own.But I would like that there should be more publicity of the scheme, all our banks should be more sensitive and help more and more small people.Are and we want to give it to it, it is good but more My love is to be my love countrymen 31 October, on the day of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary, I had discussed an Bharat Shrestha Bharat.

I made an opportunity for expression. I had given one day that what dignity did the selfie with doctor and daughter get and when he used to do a selfie doctor, he used to encourage his daughter's courageBut when people used to see a commitment within themselves He also felt that he was indifferent to daughters, now he would have to leave a silent revolution. Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I told such citizens, I had told such citizens.I will see that like this had talked about hockey bhulki, but it was very amazing, in millions, people sent such a picture of every corner of India. Perhaps the tourism of the Government of India has the tourism depot of the state government.Such a legacy is one Everything came on the platform and the government did not spend ₹ 1.It was prayed that we are believing on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2 October, there was a time, what is not a standing formation.This is not done by any government advertisement, urban carbon Once I have not spent money, I said that I said that the stove burns in the poor house. Children remain bread. Poor demand does he not get gas cylinders and I prayed to the rich people that you can't do the subsidy SurendraThink and I want to say with great joy today, 30 lakh families of this country have given up the subsidy of gas cylinders and this rich people have not seen middle class lower middle classes whose subsidy is difficult to leave but such people have left how to leave the silent revolution.There is no many people There is no philosophy of the government.The power is reduced by reducing the form of a good catering agent. In the mother's talk, I had faith in all the things in which I was confident, but I turned back in reverence and so today, mother's talk today, once again, once again, the manpower is once againI want to pay obeisance Created the vision and tried to connect myself for the good of the country, what could be greater satisfaction, I had prayed to the citizens of the country that you should telephone and register your questions, I am on my mother's talkI will pay attention that I am happy that more than 55 thousand of the country are very important, but my experience was being told that these 55 thousand people had to tell their way in their own way.It was like a complete level in the shadow of the mother's talk Positive suggestions, autobiography, identical creation, ie, see the general citizen of the country taking positive thinking, it is how big capital is this, probably 1% of the country can have 1% 2% phones that have an atmosphere of serious type of complaint or else 90More than a % of an energy filling pleasure, people have got a lot of calls, but it will be that it will not be able to watch this TV.This has brought a new new I am looking in the aspect and have told such good things, these people and these people are enough to make the government sensitive. I have given a message from Alwar Rajasthan, I believe that the whole country should listen to Pawan Acharya.And the whole country should accept what they want to say, I am definitely listening to Alwar, and I will be able to get my message from Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, that please you this time in the talk of mother to the people of India, the people of the whole India countryMake a sound that more and more soil on Diwali Use the Pedia, it will benefit the environment, and thousands of Kumar brothers will get employment opportunities. Thank you Pawan, like Pawan, your feeling will definitely reach every cori of India, it will fail well, good suggestions and soil has been given.So there is no goods and hence the clay is also precious, it has an important significance from the environment and it is a Banta, small people in the poor's house are at least their stomach and I definitely say to the foreigners.Pawan Acharya in the upcoming festival If we agree, then it means that Diya will burn in our house, but Roshni will be in the poor house of the poor, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got an opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of C.If we do not get a lot or view, the war of Army Air Force Navy 1965, which was completed 50 years with Pakistan, has composed a Shauryanjali exhibition near India Gate in Delhi, I was seen from the shade.Was for half an hour but when it was removed It has been two and a half hours and yet something incomplete has been incomplete. There is no greater inspiration to serve the motherland. There is no more inspiration. Moments and our fighters used to hear all in the admiration and sacrifice of our fighters, they used to hear that so much photography was not available at that time.There was not so much video graph, from the middle of this exhibition, there is a feeling of fighting Haji Pir Ho should be a battle of Chaminda and if we look at the scene of the victory of Hajipur nearby and proud of their soldiersPeople who have participated An inspiration used to give an inspiration, if you want to make history, then it is important to understand to know the nuances of history. History is connected to us with our own history, if Nata is done with history, then the possibilities of making history are also fulfilled in the midst of this valor exhibition.There is a feeling of history from history. I am that for the true campaign you have run, you should get dustbin everywhere in every street, we should also make cleanliness and arrangements should also be made for cleanliness. I got a great satisfaction of this child's messageOn October, I announced to run the campaign for Swachh Bharat and I can do it, perhaps after independence, it must have happened for the first time that I am also discussed on the topic of cleanliness till hour, nowadays, we are criticized by our government nowadays.It is also heard a lot that Modi Shri used to talk very big things, but what happened, I do not consider it big, I am seeing that the MP of the country is also discussing for the cleanliness of India and on the other side, see the MP and on one side this on the one handTalk about both the infants of the country, what can be the good fortune of the country than this, the movement that is going on, the atmosphere of hatred towards the dirt has come towards cleanliness, it has come towards cleanliness to reduce the governments tooWill force local Swaraj's institutions to have tea panchayats Whether it is a municipality to be a municipality, whether it is a municipality or a state or center, everyone has to reduce this movement, we have to move forward even while the cameo and this India in 2019 when the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019We will celebrate, we should reduce the direction of fulfilling Mahatma Gandhi's dreams and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say, once he has said that both freedom and cleanliness have to be one likeMore than independence for The importance of wideness came to all of us to fulfill Mahatma Gandhi's talk man and his wish, we also went from Delhi, Gulshan Arora ji has left a message on Me God.I want to know that the life of my love countrymen is always the reason for all the inspiration and we are not less to evaluate the ideology of the less men of us.Both of them have so many great men There has been an opportunity to remember on 25 September Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Mahatma Gandhi Lal Bahadur Shastri on October 11, Jai Prakash Narayan ji, on October 31, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 2, 2 October, the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu Mahatma Gandhi, I also said last yearYou will have every type of fashion clothes, there will be every type of fabric, but there will be a place of standing in it, I say once again that there is a concession in 1 month from October 2 to 1 month, it should be taken advantage of.And with khadi- The hand handloom should be given the same importance, how hard our weavers do work, so the countrymen will also buy a handle of ₹ 5 ₹ 10 ₹ 50.The poor widow will go to the house and hence in this Diwali, we must give a place in our house to give a place in our house, I never urge it, and have become completely the urge to be completely standing and doubled the sale of sales.How many poor people have benefited, less government mother does this bliss to you I should also meet a little taste.He had given him the day that Subhash Babu's large family, the Chandra Bus and his families, who came to the Prime Minister's residence, were engaged in this low and last week I got confirmation that more than 50 Subhash Babu's family is going to come to the Prime Minister's residence.You can imagine me There will be a great happiness for the people, Netaji's family may have come together for the first time in his life, but it is a matter of happiness for me that it is a matter of pleasure for me that the good fortune of such guest Nawaji in the Prime Minister's residence everI will not have come to which I am going to get in October, more than 50 family members of Subhash Babu live in different countries.I got from Bhargava Canada And her manner of speaking is her voice, I felt that she seems to be the leader herself and perhaps it will be the leader, it seems that I want to request the Prime Minister that you should awaken the younger generation in the elder of water registration.In the coming time, the nature of the younger generation has increased and in the future, the important support of the younger generation should be in the Chunni and you can also be able to vote, thanks and to vote, it is right that in democracy, every voter is the fate of the country and it is the fate of the country and thisAwareness is slowly flooding The percentage of the percentage is also flooding and I want to specially congratulate the Election Commission of India for this. A few years ago we used to see that our election commission has been reducing only as a regulator but for the last few years it is very bigChanges have come, today our election commission has not been just a regulator, a way has become a facilitator and their saree is a relief in the center of voters in sari plans. This is a very good change, but only in the Election Commission, maintaining this awakening atmosphere in the locality in the Election CommissionI want amu The right that has been received is my right or not, I am not using the right or not, we should all make a habit, the language of the country, if the youth of the country have not registered in the voter list, then there should be voting and voting must also be done.And I should say that in both of the Chavan, I say that first voting is so sacred, it is so sacred, everyone should visit Kashi after visiting Kashi, many people met many programs, but they met so many people but two children met so many children.Whom I want to talk to you He has to study in seventh grade in Kendriya Vidyalaya in the university, how is Rail Accident how Rock Jain is, how should the expenses be reduced in energy.Well, I could not close him closely to see how close it is in what he is, but his confidence level should increase his interest in our country's children's interest in science.Why should a child Manju should ask, in the same way, Sanam Patel met a very young girl, 9 years old. Sadavri Patel, a resident of Sundarpur in Varanasi, used to definitely definitely definitely definitely defined her father, and said she has been speaking since the age of 5, I said.He said that we do not even know, so I said and what is the condition in studies, only the Gita keeps on falling and if he takes some hand, then in the evening, he has all the free text in the evening, take history and remember everything in the evening, he saidWe have been laughing for people too, how in the whole family Hai I was really very impressed, sometimes some children get fond of celebrity. The right 100 number was nothing, God has given him some power, these two children were getting a special meeting in my Kashi journey.So I thought you also tell you that you see what you see on TV, we also do a lot of Shivaay, and sometimes there is some enjoyment of such kemon, so that I remember my conversation with two children.I have seen that some people in my mother's talk Let's come to see what Sandeep of Haryana is that you should talk about the mother once a month, because you should get a lot of inspiration in the newspapers, what will you get Sandeep ji, what will you do to do me.Even for I have to work so much, I have to adjust so much time, sometimes all our colleagues of our Akashvani have to sit in half a half Poona Poona Hour, but I give the basis of your feeling for your suggestionI am grateful to you right now It is okay that one year of mother's talk has completed one year. You know how much Subhash Babu used to use radio, Germany started his radio from and he felt that the citizens of India felt about the freedom movement of radio.He used to tell the middle of the middle of Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin, he had presented English Hindi Bengali Marathi Punjabi, in all speeches, these radio usedMother's talk is true In the sense, your mother has become a matter of your words, I think for you, I have seen your suggestions, this is the race of my thoughts, the race is the caste which reaches you from the middle of AIR, I am to speak but it is yours but it is yours and this is your thing and this is your thing andSo my satisfaction is my satisfaction next month, you will get again for the mother's talk, your suggestions are also beneficial, the government also benefits the improvement."

I had to open an account with the rich balance of the poor.But the poor saved and saved 22000 crores by saving 22000 crores Get it done, the mainstream banking sector of the economy is also and this system has reached the poor's house, so the bank friend's plan has also been given hair, today more than a million bank friends are reducing the country across the country, the youth have also got employment.It would be a pleasure that in this 1 year the banking sector economy and poor men should not be attached by opening an account to connect them and now many thousands of people became entitled to take overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they took it.Also the poor get money from the bank It can be taken, this belief has also been born, I once again congratulate everyone and all the poor brothers who open the bank's account urge that you should not let you break the beauty from the bank, this bank is yours, you do not leave it.I should have brought you to you, now it is less your account to hold it.If anything happens on the land, then the country has the most Hale, shock reaches pain, but in a very short time, all my enlightened all my citizen brothers and sisters played an active role in preventing the situation from running away and then once on the path of peace, Gujarat went to Gujarat, Shanti unity brotherhoodAnd on the path of development, we have to walk by strangling the shoulder to shoulder.His talk to I got the opportunity of Saiya, in a way, the selection of his words as a music is having a way of his conversation, that is, the generosity in the happy tradition, which is a gentleness in which the music is taken, I felt the feeling of all of them in the midst of these scholars.Perhaps it is nice to bring the world to the right nature of Islam in the right way.Why do we believe any sect But sometimes all traditions should be understood. In India, scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss the global topics related to mankind.I have kept me very much to come, the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru had become enough, I am going to get the opportunity of Bodh Gaya Jaan with these scholars around the world.Once you have special form Today, I want to tell the mother about the mother, I have heard this subject in the first mother's talk, you must have heard in the MP, I must have heard in public meetings, I must have heard in the mother's talk, I have been saying one thing every time that I have been saying that, sirThere is a dispute in relation to the Land Acquisition Act, the government's mother is open about who is ready to accept any suggestion of the hit of the government, but today I have to say this to my farmer brothers and sisters.From Agra East and everyone felt that the village is poor Neither house has to be done, to identify water to the fields, you have to build a pillar to recognize electricity in the village. Roads have to be built for the village. If you have to provide arrangements for employment to build houses for the poor of the village, then we are right if we are rightThe law would have to be removed from the clutches and then there was a proposal to improve the improvement, but I saw that the farmer who was spread so Brahm was so frightened, my farmer brothers and sisters, my farmer should be confused and brother should not be harvested and I should not be harvested and I should not be harvested.Do not give such an opportunity to anyone I want to whichever fear of whom to confuse who has the importance of every voice in the country, but who has special significance of the voice, we released an ordinance. Yesterday, the limit of ordinance is ending on 31 August and I am endingIt has been allowed to be expired. It means that the situation that was formed before it was now proposed to him but there was a less incomplete in it and that was 13 such points which had to be completed in a year and that's why we were therefore in ordinanceHad taken him, but due to disputes, that matter also It is as being made, but who is going to get the direct benefit of who has direct economic benefits, we are bringing those 13 points under the rules and implementing it today so that we did not have to harm, today we fulfill it.They are and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not this slogan for us, this is our mantra. The village is the welfare of the poor farmer and only then we said on August 15 that not only the agriculture department but agriculture and farmersWelfare department will be made, whose decision we have a lot of decision If you have taken forward fast, then the farmer brothers and sisters now have any action of Brahma and do not try to make any fear, then you need to be afraid, I need to be afraid.And when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra and it is very natural for all those martyrs who maintain the tricolor flag of India today, I salute the heroes and suchWe continue to get inspiration from the events of history. I got an opportunity to meet the people of Sufi tradition for a week, thus it was a very pleasant experience. I got an opportunity to listen to the country with the distinguished scientists of the country and I got the opportunity to listen to and I was happy India in the field of science in many directions in the field of science.In the very best type of reducing the principles of how to convert the principles into equipment, students should pursue science further. Our educational institutions should also inspire students to take interest in,Prakash Tripathi has given hair on good teachers for primary education, the teacher has given hair on the area in the area that on August 15, I had told the red banana that why this interview for the star of the star and then when the interview If it comes tomorrow, every poor family will get a widow mother recommendation, with whom the job will get a job.On August, I said that I want to get rid of a star below the tradition of interview, I am happy that it has been 15 days in such a short time, but the government is flooding very fast.Guests of many countries of the world have come to health in both India For the sight, the fear of death, especially for the fear and infant death fears, for her work plan, you got into the land of India together.That even today, there is in our country, about 50000 mothers and 13 lakh children are every year at the time of presentation and immediately after that they have caste, it is worrying, it is scary that the improvement has been enough, the international star has started to be appreciated by India on the international star too.Still standing here is no less like we Having got rid of polio, he has to save the death of mother and baby, but it is very easy to protect and I am talking about what I am talking about clean India.There is an advertisement printed in the newspaper, but our attention is not known.

do not want to preach and no, I am looking for a way to save the responsibilities of the units of local Swaraj institutions.But I got my eye and after the accident, the scooter driver kept suffering for 10 minutes, he has not got any help, I have seen that many people keep writing in the fact that you say something on the road safety.Akshay ho pun We should be a bald of the happiness of Muridi of Karnataka, I am not telling the names of everyone in the name of a lot of people, and said that you are all worried and when we look at the figuresThere is an accident every minute in the country, Karan Road Accident due to Karan Road Accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes and the biggest concern is also that about one third of those who are 15 to 25 years old are young people.A death gives the whole family a shaking Which I request the parents, whether your children, whether you walk a wheeler or the four wheeler, should definitely create an atmosphere of attention in the family, sometimes we see on the auto rickshawPapa happens to go home quickly and if you want to read, then it is true that it is true that the government has taken a lot of new universities in this direction, whether it is a matter of education for road safety, there is an engineering of road creation.Be it after enforcing the law or after accident Keeping in mind the emergency care of the injured people, keeping in mind these saree buttons, we are going to bring road transport and safety bills, we are going to bring the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plane in both of them, we are also less important in the direction of implementation of the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plane.Cashless treatment Gurgaon Jaipur and Vadodara will not give phones from there to

Nagpur division, there is victory and now they are fond of painting, now they could also go to the story and do painting but they have to do the same to the railways and they are the railway and the railways.I work and keep painting the related view of the railway, they also get a pleasure and it is so much interest in the flood caste.One more thing came to my meditation, Madhya Pradesh The Puri team of government officials of Harda district started a less that my mother started and I like it very much, they started the operation, the operation freight will be something else to listen to it, but there will be something else but it will be something else butThe basic thing is that he has given a new mode to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and he has launched a campaign in the entire district, Bhai number one i.e. the best brother who should wait a toilet to his sister on Rakshabandhan and he has taken up all suchToilet to their sisters by inspiring brothers In the entire district, the story of the story of the mother and sisters has to go to think, they are doing it on the paw of Rakshabandhan, see how the meaning of Rakshabandhan has been cloudy, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.Sometimes I came to Pay, I give me a little bit of small thing, so I am listening to you, there is a small village in Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, there is a small village, the people of the village have tried to make a toilet by trying to make a toilet.Campaigned and now it was in any village The person does not have to go to the shock in the open, but when the whole village is fulfilled, the whole village celebrated the festival like a very big festival, the village celebrated this accomplished village and celebrated a very big blissHow the values are cloudy in life, how the public is cloudy and how the citizen of the country is taking the country forward, the best examples are coming in front of me.People are active too and It is a good thing to write a lot, but today I want to tell them happily that there is a separate ministry for the North East when Atal Bihar Vajpayee was Prime Minister, then a donor minister became a donor minister.After that, our donor has made a big important decision in the depot that North will be done by sitting in Delhi and everyone together has done that the team of officials of the Government of India will go to those states of North East, Nagaland Home Manipur and Arunachal Ho Tripurayes It is evening and will camp, will go to the districts and go to the districts and meet the local government officials and talk to the public representatives, they will talk to the citizens and listen to the people, they will also make efforts to solve the problems.Both of them will take very good results in both of them and the officials who come and come and also feel how many beautiful people have to continue to develop this area, they have to be solved by solving their problems, then return with this resolution Even after coming to Delhi, now it has become very easy to understand the problems there, so a good effort has been a good effort from Delhi to far and wide, which I have been of this policy, nor is this act, my love, my love countrymen, all of us we allWe are proud that we enjoy the success of the route mission. Right now both India has launched five satellites by PSLV C28.

It is a matter of great concern that Science and Technology is a kind of DNA. Our new generation is to become a scientist.

I had done with Calcutta, in such a short time, there has been a lot of positive resultWe are putting more than 10 crore people in such a short time, the story N story has been added to the schemes of these life security, but we have to take it further, my mother comes to the idea, I have to put this idea in front of you if in this monthThe festival of Rakshabandhan comes, do we all Before the festival of Rakshabandhan, create a tremendous birth movement before the festival of Rakshabandhan and the mother and sisters of our country have this life security schemes, give it the benefit of that, if there is a sister in our house or a sister to clean the utensils, it is a laborer in our field.If there should be a sister in our family, should our family make excuses in our family, keeping in mind the holy festival of Rakshabandhan, we can give gifts to our sisters for life, with ₹ 12 or 330 life security schemesThis is a very big gift that Do not we see the Pav of Rakshabandhan a goal of 2 crore 5 crore 7 crore 10 crore, then how many sisters can we get, we can reach with me and we all try to fulfill this resolve with me, when I am mother's mother when mother's motherTalking about many people, many people also send suggestions to me, this time I should say something for the monsoon.Tell me some things in the matter They send them to Jhan and anyway, this season is a big question season to the mother and first of all, why does it rain at any age, mother does the mother to enjoy rain at any ageLife gives life.It should be our resolve to make efforts to stop water and And rain water stops and if it goes back into the ground, then our problems are resolved throughout the year, Rainwater Harvesting is not new. I have been going on for centuries. I always tell people if MahatmaIf you go to Porbandar in Gujarat, the birth place of Gandhi and go to see Mahatma Gandhi's house, then there is a tank in the geology inside his 2-year-old house, in which there was a straight rainwater, there was a system of life and you will go and see Mahatma GandhiIf you go to see the place of birth, then definitely see Even after 200 years, even today, the same is working and the water is not spoiled at all throughout the year. Porbandar but sweet water was kept in the house by collecting rain water and kept in the house, it also had such a caste of so much care.We can also do this and this life movement should be Banna, the village should be a village, in this way, how much is the greenery, how much our eyes are like in every India life, tree plants make the bag garden life every India.Campaign to plant trees in the weather by social organizations The youth should be in a very big mantra by the youth and I give a suggestion and my waiting experience is a very successful experience. It is absolutely rural technology, if you plant a plant, then put an old earthen pot next to the plant andFill the water in it, I will fill the water a couple of times, even if you fill the water, the pottery will be found, your property will be found, the most disease has come, the doctor does not even get free time and we know that in both the rainDiseases with water The prophet is spread in the environment, the prophet floods are felt on the bacteria due to the flood and cleanliness is very important, cleanliness is very important, it is a caste and urge to drink pure water is necessary relief. Most people boil and drink water at such a time.And its benefits are also there.Lions live life To make the world, he has raised a big business, in this way, such a country should also be able to equal the world in the country, there should be smart cities of the world and on the other hand, the poor people of the country should also have their own home to live.And the house also has electricity that has water, the school is arranged to study near toilets. In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of independence, we want to give homes to the countrymen, I have started a big plan about these three buttons.It is believed that this sarees in bringing changes in urban life The schemes will be reduced, a person sitting in the village far away is also our heart, after that, you know that a daughter Bachao Beti Padhao program is going on from the government, but when a person's program is made by a person, society, the society can make the village own.Then how much flood caste is his strength, Sir Sunil Jagalan, the sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana, took him a very funny intelligence. He took a selfie beat doctor to take a selfie with his daughter and put the mother on social media, compared the children in Haryana.Bali in The number of people is very less from about 100 districts of the country, in which even the situation is worrisome, the most in Haryana, but the sarpanch of this Haryana sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan gives this type of mode, then they have a lot of pleasure and a newAsha is awakened, so I express my happiness but I have also got inspiration from this incident and so I also urge you that you also post a selfie with your daughter with your daughter and post a selfie with your daughter.The dog is in any language Shakti is English, be Hindi, you will be a great man, I will repeat a marriage, we can all, save daughter, daughter, can convert this into a life movement, which started by brother Sunil from Bibipur village of Haryana and we all togetherTake forward and I urge you to have a hashtag selfie with doctor.Best wishes rain Enjoy our country, make our country greenery, you should keep International Yoga Day for 1 day.You can post many such things will be divided in your city, even poor people will also make skills, they can also send it to us, we are reaching the world, we have to deliver the characteristics of India all around and this simple middleWe have we definitely My love is my love countrymen, today just this is the only thing for the next mother to talk, some people feel that I will declare the big schemes of the government, I will not declare the big schemes of the government.I am keeping talking lightly to you, I just enjoy it, thank you very much"

Also, this is the chance that you have succeeded in your life, I will do it that success in life is natural, which considers success as an opportunity, he also laid the foundation of success, which makes himself successful by success.It is never successful in life. We can learn a lot from success and sometimes success is also an opportunity to recognize you, your powers are the opportunity of the people and may be that you know your powersKnowing your energy, listen to a new path to me to our country Former President Shri APJ Abdul Kalam ji has remembered that he became a affair of his life in his book in his book in his book, he became a affair of his life and he was a great contribution to the molecular power of the country, so I say I say the burden of success of friendsI have an opportunity to know success like this, keep the success even by holding success, even in the midst of success, the opportunity of hope is contained and my special request is to my young friends and especially their family members, if the son is successful if it is successful.Gaya then mother Hool should not make such a sari to hopes in life, sometimes the success of the child is a caste associated with the dreams of the parents and they get a crisis when I am talking to you in the meantime.Sari talks happened, my government has been closely analyzed by the whole country and criticized it and many people also gave us disturbing route, so this churning is very important in democracy. The opposition is necessary.It is very important to know what good is his There is also a benefit of its own, but for me, two things of the last month give pleasure to my mother. In our country, there is always a yearning in my heart to do something for the poor, I think of new things, suggestionsWhen I come, I accept it, we have launched three schemes of social security, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, it has not been 20 days to the schemes, but today I say with pride with pride.Shocking by relying on the government in the country Trusting the plans of R, in such a big mantra, the general Mahavira joins him in such a big mantra, I am happy to tell that in just 20 days, more than 8 crore 52 lakh people got their enrollment in these schemes and attended the scheme.We are very less in the direction of social security, and it is going to be very beneficial for both of them, who have reached there till now, their request is that you can take advantageJust ₹ 12 of the month and you get safety insurance scheme Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana daily less than ₹ 1 i.e. 330 of the year, I say that the poor have to stay dependent on others, the poor should become strong, we are lifting it less in the direction and I am a lesson in the direction and I am such a soldierI want to make and choose from the poor in the military and this military made from the poor will fight against poverty, it will cross poverty and it is a burden on our heads of many years in the country, it is a burden on our headWe kept trying continuously and success is another important thing that will bring me to me Nand e is it is the Kisan TV channel, although there is a lot of TV INLD in the country, what is not a cartoon channel, India's channel is runningIt is important because I know the future like this, I know the farmer channel, in my view, the open university with a field is a similar channel whose student is also a farmer and whose teacher is also a farmer to learn from excellent experiences from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture from modern agriculture.To move forward There are pieces of small lands. The families are small, the family grows up, the part of the land is small and then how to change our land productivity, it is important to understand how to change these buttons in the crop, now the weather should be known beforehand.It can be done with this saree that this TV channel reducing and my farmer brothers and sisters have been arranged for farmer monitor in every district, now I would like to contact my fishermen and siblings, I would like to say that I would like to say that they are connected to the fish cooking.People too for them in this farmer channel There is something, animal husbandry is the traditional low of rural life of India and is a type of help in agriculture, but if we look at the account of the world, India is far behind the number of animals in the world as compared to the number of animals in the world.As compared to milk production should not be as much as it is not in our country, how to produce more milk per animal, how to take care of animals, how is the food of Lalan Palanpur, what should be the catering of it, traditionally we do a lot but from the scientist to the triangleAhead It is very important to draw and then animal husbandry along with agriculture can also strengthen us financially, how we can move forward in the field, how we are successful in the area, you have got scientific guidance in the direction of me,Love countrymen remember on 21 June, on 21 June, the woman is remembered the longest day, but 21 June you have become a new identity for the world.And a proposal was that the difference on 21 June You should accept as National Yoga Day and the whole world is surprised, you will also be surprised, so within the day, this resolution passed with the support of 177 countries within the day. In this type of proposal, the country got the most support in the history of United Nations.The delivery passed in the shortest time and all the departments of the world are a very proud event for any Indian who attended it, but now our responsibility is our divided, what ever did we think that we can become a middle of adding yoga world tooLess our ancestors who In this, yoga was made in it, how is it a matter of great pride to connect the world as a katali agent, but its strength will be made when we all will be the right power of yoga to the right form of yoga in a very big mantraPresent in front of the world.The available reason should be celebrated on 21 June Yoga Day in every corner of India. Ripe relatives live in any country in any country of the world, if your friend family lives, you should also tell them that they also gather people there and after gathering people there, if they do not have any knowledge by doing yoga, then take a book, then take a bookEven after lying, everyone has understood what it is to read a letter, but I believe that we really have been a gurjar from life as the welfare of human Jat as an important low for world welfare and life from stressHuman groups sitting desperate amidst the difficulties The support of giving new conscious energy to Nav is in yoga, I would like the world that the world has honored and what India has given to the world, this yoga should be a matter of pride for all of us, you are still three weeks left.Must try to definitely connect and also add others. I will urge me, I want to say one more thing, especially my C soldiers who have shoes in the security of the country today and who today retire from C and live their livesFor the country doing renunciation for the soldiers who are doing penance and I am not doing this on the basis of a Prime Minister, the person within me wants to talk to the soldiers of my country today with the depth of the heart, One Rank One Pension is not many truths that the question has been complicated for 40 years.Is it not the truth, all the governments before who said this, do not I assure you, I have promised in the midst of the soldiers of the Nehubh that my government will apply rank one pension, we are not responsible and the government is not responsible and the governmentAfter making it, different departments are also less on it I did not believe as simple as I used to be complicated and for 40 years, the problems have been added to it.It is not necessary to give it in the media. There is no running country, I assure you that this government again says that this government will remain your bunn one pension masala solution and we have come from the ideology that we have come from the ideologueWe are moving forward with the ideal I have a lot of importance of your life.

I once again to all the soldiers of my countryI will urge that people who have been playing political bread are playing with you for 40 years. I do not accept that path and no I want to raise any less that complicates the problems, now trust me in me, the rest who have to throw things will have to dispute.Will be your politics Rani will have to be happy, do what I can do for those who live for the country, this is my Radhe and I believe that my mother's talk in which Shivaay is nothing, your hearts will reach your hearts for 40 years, I have kept my patience for 40 yearsGive it an opportunity to reduce and we will sit together and solve the problems, I give confidence to the countrymen once again, in both of the holidays, everyone must have gone to the story, the story must have gone to different corners of India.People will now make a program of life natural That is the lion, when we visit it, we go to the house of relatives, the story comes to the place of tourism. There is a different opportunity to see the world who has seen the pond of his village and the first time he gives the sea, it is not known.He cannot describe how the mother's expressions are that you cannot tell your village back and tell how big the sea is, there is a different feeling from seeing you, you must have gone to the story with family with family friends in both of the holidays.Or may be their talk You should write a description of the things that are good and should be included in a way, it should be included inside yourself, looking at the same way, it should not be done by looking at it with a cruel eye, because this tour is an education in itselfThere is no opportunity for life in the Himalayas, but if you read the Himalayas and have written books, you will know what is enjoyable, they have described the journey, I do not say that you have become a writer but for the sake of visitingWe are not traveling like this Try to learn something from you. Try to understand this country. Try to understand the country. Understand its wives. Wear the food there, wearing the food, the rituals are their dream, their dreams are their desire, their difficulties are such a huge country.There is a birth lesser, you must have gone to the story, but one is my wish, this time you must have gone on the journey or you will be your experience, can you lion with me, can I really enjoy what I will enjoy, I would urge youI am that you have an incredible India hashtag Th se must send me your photos and some of them will like what I like, I will see the lion with others, then I will experience your experiences, I will also experience what you have seen, I will sit away and see it, you will see you the sea in the sea.I can walk alone by going to the coast, I do not know now but I would like to know your experiences and lion with everyone, I liked it, today I remember once again after the heat, I would like that I would like you to handle youDo not be insured, we have to save you from heat There are people, but to take care of those animal birds too, this mother's talk has become enough today, the thoughts that I used to speak, I will get the next time again, then I will talk again, I will talk very well, thank you very much, thank you very much"

9g6XsVfL6aQ,PM Modi shares 'Mann Ki Baat' with Farmers | Mann ki Baat 6th Episode,https://youtube.com/watch?v=9g6XsVfL6aQ,2015-03-21,"[Sangeet] My love farmer brothers and sisters, greet you all, it is my good fortune that today I get an opportunity to talk to the farmer, my farmer brothers and sisters living in a remote village of the country, so in a way I talk to the villageI talk to the villagers, I am also talking to the farm laborer, I am also talking to the mother and sisters who reduce the field and in this sense, I can say all my mother till now when I have givenIf I think to talk about mother with me, I don't want to imagine that far away People with gram flour in the village will ask me so many questions, I do not know so much sari information, you will have to face me, but I have given me a surprise, but I consider this mother's talk of a training for me and my farmer brothers and sistersI assure you that I have talked about all the questions you have raised, I can not be strengthened to live in such a situation in the Puri government about all the questions you have talked about.Who related to farming Dhit has written things, but he has said to more poet, how many problems are there, how many problems are there with the mafia.Early post has been there, someone has been drinking dirty water in the village. Some have discussed that someone has worried about the arrangement to keep their animals in the village, some have even said that if the animal goes, then it is only to remove it.Managing is not a disease failed caste, that is, how much expectation It has happened and today the people sitting in governance with the mother's talk are getting a standing message, we have the right to rule when we also pay attention to these small buttons, then I would sometimes feel embarrassed by reading all this.What we have done, I do not have the answer.I also know that if there is less rain last year, trouble So this time, this time, this time, in a way, in all the states above Maharashtra, this trouble has become upset by the farmer, his life passes throughout the year, everything has been destroyed, I am with you in this hour of crisis.All the departments are studying the situation closely by staying in touch with the states. My ministers have also come out.Can help i believe you I provide that the government will help you with full urgency in your time of crisis with full condolences.No, there is also anger, it is not getting electricity, who is also worried that the children will get a good job, it is a habit but also express my anger and send it to me, I can understand your pain, I can understand your pain.If the government plans, then you get to hear a lot But the farmer does not reach us, the farmer also says that we do so hard work, but when we do not, we do not get all the money, when the goods are sold, it is not going to take it.Even if you yield more, they die, even if they die less, they die, that is, who has spoken in front of me, I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that I am also to Rajesh Sarkar and all our departments of the Government of IndiaI will also activate these attest speed I will motivate me to find a way to solve the problems, I am feeling that your patience is decreasing.The effect of the current land acquisition bill from almost all the states is more visible and I am surprised that how Brahma has been spread, good, you have asked small questions, I have asked me to try that I will get verified now, now I know the land acquisition of land acquisitionLaw 12 It came 0 years ago, even after being independent of the country, the same law went on 6065 years and who are running the movement of who today, they also ran the country under this law.There should be a change in the law, we also believed that we were in opposition, we also believed that Haryana had started 2013 where there were Congress governments and the farmers who do medicine for the beneficiaries, they did the compensation in this ordinance.Half it was half, now it is a little again with whom It is important to see that there are some shortcomings in Anand Bhave and there are caste, perhaps the intention is not wrong, but if we have shortcomings, then we should fix it and we do not have any of our old government what the old government wants, what did not want to wanted what our intention isWho should be good for the children of the village as well, and therefore, if there is any shortcomings in the law, then our authentic effort is to remove the cameo, as many people who are farmers are winning such a big speech by becoming farmer friendlyWe do not know different types There are 13 laws in India in which the maximum number of land is edited like the caste of the Railway National Highway mine.For the most land that is the highest land, who would get the same compensation in the earlier law, tell me that it was lacking that we did not fix the mistake and we said that brother, brother, your baby, your baby, good government, to take the land to the government.You may be for the railway to build a highway But his idiom should also be introduced to the farmer by taxing the farmer, we have improved someone, if this reform is anti -farmer, do we have to bring an ordinance, if we do not delay the ordinance, then the land of the farmer, then the land remains a caste from the old law.There is no money, even when this law was made, the people sitting in the government had taken out the opposing voice of themselves, the people who made themselves made the form of the law, they became very angry and said that who did this law for the goodThere is no country for the good of the village This law is for the good of the law, where did it go to promote the right to the officer's right to fill the chest of the letters, if all this was the truth, then what should be improved that there should be no improvement and so we came to the cameoWho has tried to do good by removing it, first of all we have reduced your law which was outside the Land Acquisition Act and whose farmer was suffering the most, we should bring them to the dare of this new law so thatThe farmer gets full compensation and has all the rights Now an air has been spread in such a way that Modi is bringing such a law that now the compensation will not get the compensation less. My farmer brothers and sisters cannot even think of such a sin.There has not been any difference in it, we have accepted even the matter of taxing compensation, not only that, we have also added that we have not only added that the land developed for urbanization, 20, 20 developed land developed in the land developed 20He will get Bhoomi Malik so that he will financially We have also continued to get the benefits, the family of the family should get a job, the children of the farm laborers should also get a job, we have continued this, not only that we have added a new thing, no, it is not a pair that the officers of the district are the officers.This will have to declare that who will get the job, in which the job will be given, where the government will get less in writing, we have fixed the new thing and fixed the responsibility of the government, my peasant brothers and sistersUse of Banjara land after that Use of diamonds should be mandatory in the house and then the fertile land should be put in hand and hence it has been asked to conduct a Banjara role immediately, due to which he was the first priority that he has made a complaint right, and grab more land than the requirement of our complaint right.Lee caste is from the middle of this new law, I want to assure you that now how much land will be taken, it will be investigated first, after that, the land will not be grabbed more than the requirement, sometimes something is going to happen something is going to happen.There is a lot of damage in its anxiety In the name of Cut Assessment, Sunny kept going for years, tell me, in such a situation, if a farmer will be able to make his decision, what is the crop, then you will not know what to do, if he will do the decision, then what will I do and his two-four years will be spoiled.The type of plants will be forced to be forced to cook on the poor officer, sir, do not write this, do not write it, do not write it, it is going to happen, I am going to be my own officer, who is my officer that I have been stuck once again in the electionI think she was not well, I tried to simplify it My peasant brothers and sisters, in 2014, law is fine. The states did not accept it, the farmer opposed the same, the states have opposed it, tell me, do I listen to the states or not to listen to the camera or not, or not to do such a big countryCan the states believe by trusting and that's why we should trust the states, even if the Government of India should do special special, even if a state does not believe it, it is free and hence I want to tell you that all thisBrahma is being spread That sheer farmer is the Brahm of protest, it is a part of the conspiracy to keep the farmer poor, do not take the country forward, the conspiracy is part of the conspiracy which is part of this, the country is also to save the country, the farmer has to save someone, now the farmer in the village tooAsk, brother, there are three sons, tell me what you are thinking, then he says, brother, one son will do farming, but two have to pay money somewhere in the job, now the sons of the village farmer also want a job, they also want to go and wish the story and wish for employment.If we have to make arrangements for him, then we thought that for the good of the village It is necessary for the betterment of the farmer, it is necessary for the employment of the children of the farmer, such things should be added, in this way we are Jai Jawan, Jai Jawan means Jai Jawan means that the defense of the country is about the defense of the country, HindustanThe farmer of the farmer has never retreated, if there is any need in the security field, then who will have to burn the land from the land and I will believe that we have added the matter of taking the land for these cheeseRoad in the village should not be needed if the field is needed If you want to be given, you will have to do the canal that you will not have to do it, even today there are poor people who do not have a house to stay home, do not want to tell me, no one should tell me, is it for industrialists, is it for Dhanna Setan, what is the truth for Dhanna SetanTry to understand, yes, I want to tell you once on the injury of Danke, even in the new ordinance, any private industry is made by the private factory to do private businessman, the laws made in 2013 to acquire land in 2013Rules will apply to them for corporate A law is going to be applicable for money for 2013, then why this lie is spread. My farmer siblings are spread a Brahman that you will not get legal rights, you cannot go to court, it is a lie.Legal rights are not filled with power, Baba Saheb Ambedkar has given us the constitution that you can go to any court of India and knock the door, then this lie has been spread, we tried to bring a system to your doorIs an authority now he has made an authority The RIT will reduce the district and who will solve the problems of your district in this authority in this authority and if you are not satisfied, then we can go to the above court now, then we have arranged that one is also told that it is also told thatIf the land was acquired, then the law returning in 5 years has been removed, no, my farmer brothers and sisters, we have said that whenever you become a project, then make sure that in how many years you will complete it and if it is completed in yearsIf you do not do it, then the farmer will be the one who wants and even We have closed this limit, what happens today, but the government has done anything yet, otherwise it cannot run, then we have tied the government in the limits, yes, write on some projects that brother will complete it in so long, then we will fulfill the government, we will do the government to the governmentBanda is the responsibility of the government, I have told the responsibility of the government, I can tell one more thing, sometimes the laws that make this law and the laws, nor do they not even know the true situation of the people of the village, now you see when you see when there is powerThe reservoir is Banta, its rule is that in 100 years the most water It is likely to have the rules to get land according to it, now water is not water once in 100 years, water is not water for 99 years, yet the land is the caste that is going on with the government, so what is happening in all the states today that good land paper is happening in all the statesBut you have also given money, but still he does the farmer farming on the ground because once in 100 years, when the water will be filled, it will be for 1 year. This new law was such that you could not do farming.We want that the land is not a caste in the dub, then the farmer should get an opportunity to do farming and therefore We should not take possession of the land farmer, this flexibility requirement so that even after giving land to the farmer, if you get the benefit of the land and if you get the money in return for giving land, then the farmer should have double benefit, it is also necessary to make a system and there is a business system.We have thought to the behavioral system. One Brahma is spread in such a way that there is no consensus, my farmer brothers and sisters, this politics, the caste of the things that is a child and the child is made in 2013, in 2013, the government has made the law in 2013 for the schemes for which the government has made.Ask for land There is no law of Ti and hence people are confused in the name of consent. There was no consensus for the government even before it is not today and hence my farmer brothers and sisters were very good first and we have grown this absolutely sheer.The unfortunate attempt to do is that I still say that this law of consent for private industry for private industry is on and one thing I want to say. Some people say PPP model My farmer brothers and sisters, mother, take 100 croresWhy is there a road of rupee The road is going to take care of some industry and is the road, then there is relief from the government's Malik, the land is the second one who makes the second one who makes the second one who does not have the money because the government wants that the government wants that the government wantsIn the village made in the village, the child of a hospital made in the village has been spent, it is costing to make the road, but even the private one does not make the road or takes it to its house, the road makes the government of the government.This means that the project of the government will be In this, there should be capital of anyone, which people call PPP model, but if its ownership is the relief of the government. The government is the relief of the government. The government means relief from all of you.It is not required of consent and hence these PPPs are spread, it is very important to make me clear me that brother in it, the Bhima will give the officer right and dictatorship, you tell me that you have a village, it is a village to become a road to the village.Now the road has to be built for another village The village is 5 kilometers for the village, the village has become a road to this village, but the land of these villagers is towards the village, tell me what will this village give to the people of the village to make a road for the people of the village, what will they consentSo what is the village behind the village, brother, he should not meet a road, or I should not meet, in this way, I am building a canal, this villagers have got water, but if the village has to provide water to the front village, then the land is to be provided to the villageIf it falls in the middle, he will give that brother, we will not give land If we have got water, then whether the village ahead should get a canal or not, my brothers and sisters are behavior, and therefore, there is so long for the farmer or not for the farmer, it is not for the industry for businessIt is not for the good of the village, there is another thing for the good of the farmer for the good of the farmer, I want to have a farmer in every household before that a son may be in farming but all the rest of the children live breadGo out to earn because he knows that today is the demand of the hour in the house We read different efforts to walk home, if we build a road and the government is formed next to the road. Private, not private, I only say once, I say not private, not the capitalist, not the Dhanna set, the government is not formed.It is 50 km long 100 km, and the road which is made 1 km by 1 km of road, if the government corridor is formed there so that all the villages who come nearby, 100 villages 200 villages, they get the opportunity of livelihood there, they will get employment to their children.Get me tell me These sisters, do we want the children of our village to be forced to live in the Jogi hut of Delhi and Mumbai, whether their house goes to their house 20-25 km away from the village, even a small factory goes and itIf employment is found, then it should be union or not to meet and this corridor is not private, it will form the government and make it the government and arrange to provide employment to the people of the area and therefore whose Malik is of the government and those who are for the good of the village are the villageWho has for the betterment of the sister -in -law of the sister -in -law For the betterment of the poor of the village, for the good of the village, who had deficiencies in this land acquisition bill to provide electricity water to the village farmer, it is our authentic effort to remove the cameo and yet I said in the ParliamentIt was that someone still feels that there is a shortage, then we are ready to improve it when we kept some peasant leaders in the Lok Sabha and told two or four things, we added that we still say that brother land acquisitionShould be for the good of good and this is our commitment The stems are spread.How to get the right money, how to get a good market, how to produce good storage for the maintenance of how it is our endeavor that the good of the village is raised in the right direction for the good direction of the farmer, my farmer brothers and sisters are our effort that the country is such a country.Moving forward yield on your land We have tried big and so we have tried sole health cards like a human being insured, then for his health, there is a test in the laboratory as a person is not like that, and his mother is ever like his mother, and that is why we are also of mother and that's why weNot only this, your land is also worrying about it, and therefore, your land is not more powerful, it is also less our land and hence you have come in exchange for Sohail Health Card. Every farmer will get this yearIs the useless expense of your fertilizer Your crop will increase, your crop will increase, even if you get full money of the crop, there should be good mandis, there should be good legal system, we are not exploiting the farmer but you are reducing it and you see my farmer brothers, I remember I was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, thisIn the direction, I had done very little in our Gujarat, the hands of the farmer were very bad that we made a big change on the water, there was a huge contribution of the farmer in the development of Gujarat, which could never think, the village of the village was empty.We used to change this change in the whole country Want to whom our farmer is happy and so my farmer brothers and sisters, today I got a chance to talk with you, but due to the discussion of both these ordinances, I took more time for him but my farmer brothers and sisters will tryThen once the comment will ever talk to you again and discuss the world, but I assure so much that you have sent me what you have written to the Puri government, I will come to the government that what is happening is good, you have done it very muchTell me the same thing And I believe that you believe in me, then tell me, I will not let this trust be broken, I assure you that your love should remain your blessings and you are under the world, he never thinks of anyone.He does good for the country by harming himself, it has been a tradition of it, it is not a loss of the farmer, it is a life, the government will assure you, but today my mother is a matter of my mother, after listening to my mother, many thoughts in your mother and in many thoughts andYou can definitely write me but I can write ahead Then I will talk again or if you have to fix the mistakes in the government on the basis of your letters, then I will make the mistakes correct, then I will make every effort to bring you justice, the wind of Navratri is going on."
9M2Qlh1hbRI,PM's 'Mann Ki Baat' with students preparing for board & competitive exams | Mann ki Baat 5th Episode,https://youtube.com/watch?v=9M2Qlh1hbRI,2015-02-22,"Anxiety and on the other side can be the World Cup, sometimes you must also think that after a few days, Holi is coming and then the hands of the reader must be sitting on the head, see why Holi is also useless, why the exam has goneI will know, friend, friends, I have come with you during your trouble, I have an important opportunity for you and I did not come to give you any preaching, do you think that I know your mother's status and that's why I am with you todayI have come to talk about mother, though this subject is a bit difficult today's subject But mother, you would want me to do the button that does not find my son or daughter. Your teachers will want to talk to his student so that he will reach the right thing and the student would want me to do some such things.That the pressure in my house decreases the pressure, I do not know how low my words will come, but I will be satisfied that my talk was on the important sail of friends, I was among them, my mother's words were lukewarm with them.It was just so right, my intention and anyway It is not the right that I do not have the right to write a good exam, how I wrote Jain Paper, I am a student of a normal star because I did not get good results in any exam in my life, such a minor as people want to study, I was like that and from aboveMy handwriting was also very bad, so maybe sometimes I used to pass because my teacher will not be able to lying my paper, well that he has become different things, but I would definitely like to say one thing today that I would like to say that todayHow do you take the exam How will your exam depend on the maximum people, I have seen that they consider it a very important event of their life and they feel that if it is not, then the sari world will be dubStress should be intended to bring good results, no one should be sure and no exam is committing your life, it is not necessary to sleep.This is a reason for making a burden That our relatives who are our friend, their son or daughter are studying in the equality of our son, if your son is in 10th and the son of your relatives in tenth, then your mother always compare this that my son is relieved by themYou should go ahead to your friend, should be ahead of the son, just this is the worm in your mother, it makes your son a pressure on your son, you feel that my son's name becomes illuminated in my loved ones and the son's name is fineYou want to illuminate your own name that you don't feel It is said that by bringing your son in this normal competition, life has been raised in life, can't you add a very big height of life to a very big prevalence of life.Your satisfaction will be your satisfaction. Think once in the mind, it is a competing with the people of equal and how much it is to make your own son's life small. Talk to the children. Talk about the high flight, now see the change will start, friends, friends.There is one thing that bother us very much We are always the beginning to measure our progress as compared to someone else, when our full power is caste in competition, but for our own development, the competition does not give as much inspiration as it is as much as to keep competing with itself every daySnake competition is the competition to do good competition and the competition to do more and the competition to reach a new height, now do it by yourself.You will give you so much satisfaction Anand will give bliss, which you cannot imagine, we remember the athlete head with great pride and proved the new concept.There are many types in students too, some people, how many examinations are there.Despite all this, the exam exam It is also very important to have fruits and I also want you to be successful but sometimes you must have seen that we find a lot of external karan when you are not confident in ourselves as if you are not confident in life as you are taking the exam for the first time in life.I will make a TV start loudly. It is very important to recognize yourself.If you have an exam of 12th, even if there is an exam of 12th It is only a thought that what is the strength in them that the house also helps in the house and the boys in the exam nowadays, girls are far ahead, you will take care that you will definitely meditate that you must be troubled by external karmaThere is no, sometimes Karan is inner inner, there is faith in ourselves, by the way, the effect of superstition is flooded and then in superstition, we keep looking for deception, there are some students for whom we say and we go there thereI am clearly believed that friends changing desires People say waves say that our fellow parents make fun of the mockery and so I cannot say that there is effort with resolve and when the effort is added, then the resolution becomes accomplishment, think for life from where they were and therefore every dayThere is a relief on life on the test of life, no matter how big the criterion is there, there is no crisis, and friends, why do someone commit your test, why someone takes our exam, we will take a habit, we will take our own exams ourselves and take our exam every dayI was yesterday from there went ahead today Today I am Jin I was going up from there today that I did not go today more than what I had found yesterday that every day, every day should be cast on the test every day, again, there will be a criterion in life, never take the criterion in lifeThe opportunity will be made and the one who knows how to kill himself, he does it on also and hence the classroom exam is very minor for the person who joins the test of life.Will remember it, you will also have faith in yourself that Last year, there were insurance last year, even when there was a good mark in the last time, there was a marriage in the maternal uncle's house, there was all the tower spoiled, then you were defeated, first you used to sleep for 6 hours and you did not do it last yearNow I will sleep for 5 hours and you had shown it, that is, what is it, what is Modi, you will be your guide and Lord Buddha usedAnd those who cut themselves on the test again and again on new heights It goes on and on the other sometimes we keep thinking very far, sometimes someone lives in the past, friends, do not do this at the time of exam time, it will be good to live in the present time, will thereDoes its songs hum, do you win the whole series, I will not win, I think if I will come out by century while batting in the match that I will not come out that my friends think that you think that the exam is to show your ability to showcase your abilityIf it is for If you have ripe thinking, then it is wrong, this performance is to do in front of whom you have to identify your ability to perform this examination capacity, you will catch this mantra, you will be able to get yourself and once you know yourself.If you know the strength, then you will always keep your strength add manure water and that strength will be converted into a new capable and so do not take the exam as a challenge to show the world to the world.People have an opportunity to live with themselves or have an opportunity to identity No friends, friends, I have seen that there are many students that are very nervous in taking the exam, some people have tension, look that I was trying to see me and uncle did not make me the world, uncle did not make the world bigBrother did not do the world and I do not know that his hour was for two hours, then the same debates were there in the whole family, he did his call, did he tell him, did he send a bouquet, what do you send the bouquet, friends [music] Who did not do the worldThe thing will not come in the middle In their nature, some family does not believe in yourself, do not trust yourself, when will you have a good grip on the subject, you will have hard work in every way, you will have revisit again and again, you have full faith in yesThis is my master in the subject and you must have seen it, now five or two of the subjects will be subjects in which you will never worry, nervous will have come in one or two, if you are your master on the subject, then nervousness everYou will not come hard throughout the year O night and night you have studied, now it will not believe that the story is sitting in your heart and mind, you will come to reach the exam table.I am 3 hours time, so in 3 hours, I will complete my less time in the time before time in 2 hours and we remember you may also tell you that we were small, then our teachers usedFirst of all take the difficult difficult you too I must have told and I believe that you definitely follow it, friends, I have received many suggestions in the village, I will give many experiences to the education department, but I want to mention some button, Mumbai Maharashtra has written that somePeople make the exam the Jesus of life death, if they fail in the examination, then such a world is dubbed, then Vinita Tiwari from Varanasi has written that when the greetings come and some children commit suicide, I am very painful but it is very painful but itA good answer to me someone and a gentleman He has written that he has said that do not become a student warrior, be a warrior, not going to be drowned, I should understand that I want to understand that we really take forward the resolve of victory in worry and this is the right life, life is very longThere are ups and downs, there are no dubbing, sometimes even uncertain greens indicate to advance.Let's start paper causes I have to understand how today's paper has gone, let's get the mind, why do you get the sari exam after the end of the exam, how many will not be killed, how many will not come, all will not come, all later, do it later.Centen the mother on the day itself.Will become and then when The student will go to take the exam, so the last moment, like I have taken time today, he does not have to take it, he would go on its own and sometimes I feel that what happens in the syllabus should be a class to understand what happens in the syllabus itself because it should be a class to understand because stressfulThe stage is not right, friends, what I am, why would you have said that you must have told you a lot, Master, Master will have told you, if he would have gone to tuition classes, then he must have told me that I will also talk more and do moreStrong to get entangled I do not want to do it, I assure so much, every son of this country, every daughter who is going to get upset.Make the exam a celebration, take the exam with fun and enjoy the achievement every day.I was fond of writing poems before Gujarat I wrote poetry in Shri Puri Kavita Chakra Hai Chale Rahat Hai, not successful to defeat someone, be successful to do your concept, succeed to make your own enjoyment for your own pleasure, those who are living for themselvesIn order to fill happiness in me, it will move forward by keeping this happiness in the center, now I am confident that friends will get very good success and never celebrate the festival of Holi and your future will be as bright as the future of the country will be as bright as India's future.Luck you make younger generation of India Are you son or daughter, both shoulder to shoulder, convert the celebration of the exam in Anand Utsav."
XcuZm4fEM6U,'Mann Ki Baat' with PM Modi and President Obama | Mann ki Baat 4th Episode,https://youtube.com/watch?v=XcuZm4fEM6U,2015-01-27,[Music] [Music] specialman Barack Obama AR [Music] to African countries one who is blessed African I am because we are hhi disob I request President Barack Obama to say a few words Namaste thank you Prime Minister Modi for your kind words and for the incredible Hospitality you've shown me and my wife Michelle on this visit and uh let me say to the people of India how honored I am to be the first American President to join you for Republic Day uh I'm told this is also the first ever radio addressed by an Indian Prime Minister and an American president together so we're making a lot of history uh in a short time uh to the people of India listening all across this great nation uh it's wonderful to be able to speak to you directly uh we just came from uh discussions in which we affirmed that India and the United States are natural Partners uh because we have so much in common uh we're two great democracies two Innovative economies two diverse societies dedicated to empowering uh individuals uh we are linked together by millions of proud indian-americans uh who still have family and carry on Traditions uh from India and I want to say to the Prime Minister how much I appreciate uh your strong personal commitment to strengthening the relationship between these two countries uh people are very excited in the United States about the energy that uh Prime Minister Modi is bringing uh to uh efforts in this country to reduce extreme poverty and uh lift people up to empower women uh to to provide access to electricity uh and clean energy and invest in infrastructure and the education system and on all these issues we want to be partners uh because many of the efforts that I am promoting inside the United States uh to make sure that young people get the best education possible to make sure that Ordinary People are properly compensated for their labor and uh paid Fair wages and have job security uh and Health Care these are the same kinds of issues that uh Prime Minister Modi I know cares so deeply about here and I think there's a common theme in these issues it gives us a chance to reaffirm U you what Gandhi g reminded us uh should be a central aim of our lives and that is uh we should Endeavor to see God through service of humanity uh because God is in everyone so these shared values these convictions uh are a large part of why I'm so committed to this relationship I believe that if the United States and India join together on the world stage around these values then not only will our peoples be better off but I think the world will be more prosperous and more peaceful and more secure for the future so thank you so much Mr Prime Minister for giving me uh this opportunity uh to be with you here today Barak the first question comes from Raj from Mumbai well first of all they very much wanted to come uh they are fascinated by India unfortunately uh each time that I've taken a trip here they had school and they couldn't uh leave school and in fact uh Malia had my older daughter had exams uh just uh recently so they are fascinated by the culture uh and uh the history of India uh in part because of my influence I think uh they are uh deeply moved by uh India's movement to Independence and uh the role that uh Gandhi played in not only the nonviolent uh strategies here in India but uh how those ended up influencing uh the non-violent civil rights movement in the United States uh so when I go back I'm going to tell them that uh India is as magnificent as uh they imagined uh and I am quite sure they're going to have to uh uh that they're going to insist that I bring them back uh the next time I visit um it may not be during my presidency but afterwards uh they'll definitely want uh to to come and visit and I will uh definitely do some shopping for them although I can't go to the uh the stores myself so I have to have my team uh do the shopping for me um and I'll I'll get some advice from Michelle because uh she probably has a better sense of uh what they would like M America OB or the second question for President Obama comes through email Dr kames upadhi a doctor bed in aabad Gujarat up PNE map or diabetes first lady just Bill Gates are Gates diabetes or well we very much look forward to partnering with uh organizations uh and the government and non-governmental organizations uh here in India around broader public health issues including the issue of obesity I'm very proud of the work that Michelle has done on this issue uh we're seeing a worldwide epidemic of obesity in in many cases starting at a very young age uh part of it has to do with the increase in processed foods uh not naturally prepared uh part of it is the lack of activity for too many children uh and once they're on this path it can lead to a lifetime of Health challenges uh and so this is an issue that uh we'd like to work on uh internationally uh including here in India uh and it is part of a broader set of issues around Global Health that we need to address uh the Prime Minister and I uh have discussed for example how we can uh do a better job in dealing with uh issues like pandemic and making sure that we have good alert systems so that if a disease like uh Ebola or a deadly flu virus uh or polio uh appears that it's detected quickly and then treated quickly uh so that it doesn't spread uh and you the the public health infrastructure around the world needs to be improved uh I think the prime minister is doing a great job in focusing on these issues here in India uh and has a lot to teach uh many other countries who uh may not be uh advancing as rapidly in improving this public health sector but it has an impact on everything because if children are sick they can't concentrate in school uh and they fall behind uh it has a huge economic impact on the countries involved uh and so we think that there's a lot of progress to be made here and I'm very excited about uh the possibility of continuing this work even after I leave office White 1894 religion conference religion conference compilation question himani from Ludhiana Punjab question is for you well the question is did you both imagine you would reach the positions that you've reached today and it's interesting uh Mr Prime Minister you talking about the first time you visited the White House and being outside that iron fence uh the same is true for me uh when I first uh went to the White House I stood outside that same fence and uh looked in and uh I certainly did not imagine that I would ever be uh uh visiting there much less living there uh you know I think both of us uh have been blessed uh with extraordinary opportunity uh coming from relatively humble beginnings uh and when I think about uh what's Best in America and what's Best in India the the the notion that uh atisa or uh somebody who was born to a single mother like me uh could uh end up leading our countries uh is is an extraordinary uh example of the opportunities that exist within our countries now I think part of what motivates both you and you and I is the belief that there are millions of children out there who have the same potential but may not have have the same education uh may not uh be getting exposed to opportunities in the same way and so part of our job part of government's job uh is that uh young people who have talent and who have drive and are willing to work for it uh are able to succeed and that's why emphasizing School uh higher education uh making sure that uh uh children are healthy uh and making sure those opportunities are available to children of all backgrounds girls and boys uh people of all religious faiths and all Races in the United States uh is so important because you never know who might be the next prime minister of India or who might be the next president of the United States uh they might not always look the part right uh right off the bat uh and they might just surprise you if you give them a chance thank you bar lud for or question Barak from om prash om prash is studying Sanskrit in at jnu he belongs to junju Rajasthan home is a convenor of special Center for Sanskrit studies in jnu well this is a very interesting question uh his question is the Youth of the new generation is a global citizen he's not limited by time or boundaries uh in such a situation what should be the approach by our leadership governments as well as societies at large and I I think this is a very important question you know when I look at this generation that's coming up they're exposed to the world in ways that you and I could hardly imagine they have the world of their fingertips literally they can using their mobile phone uh get information and images from all around the world uh and and that's extraordinarily powerful and what that means I think is is that governments uh and leaders uh cannot simply try to govern or rule uh by a top down strategy but rather uh have to reach out to people uh in an inclusive way and an open way in a transparent way uh and engage in a in a dialogue with citizens uh about the direction of their country uh and you one of the great things about India and the United States is we're both open societies and we have confidence and faith that when citizens have information uh and there's a vigorous debate uh that over time even though sometimes democracy is frustrating the best decisions and the most stable societies emerge and the most prosperous societies emerge and new ideas are constantly being exchanged uh and technology today I think facilitates that not just within countries but uh across countries and so um I have much greater faith in uh India and the United States countries that are open information societies uh in being able to succeed and thrive in this new information age uh then closed societies that try to control the information that citizens receive uh because ultimately that's not no longer possible uh information will flow uh inevitably uh one way or the other and uh you we want to make sure that we're fostering a healthy uh debate and a good conversation between All Peoples just how workers of the World Unite m youth unite the world CA picu M American insin am Benjamin Franklin trans well the question is as Leaders of two major economies what inspires you and makes you smile after a bad day at work and that's a very good question uh you know I say sometimes that U the only problems that come to my desk are the ones that nobody else SS uh if if they were easy questions then somebody else would have solved them before they reached me so there are days when it's tough uh and frustrating and that's true in foreign affairs that's true in domestic affairs uh but I tell you what inspires me and and I don't know Mr Prime Minister if if you you uh share this view um almost every day I meet somebody who tells me you made a difference in my life so they'll say the health care law that you passed uh save my child who didn't have health insurance and they were able to get uh a an examination from physician and they caught uh an early tumor and and now he's doing fine or they'll say you helped me save my home during the economic crisis or they'll say I couldn't afford college and the program you set up uh has allowed me to go to the university and sometimes they're thanking you for things that you did four or five years ago sometimes they're thanking you for things you don't even remember or you're not thinking about that day but it's a reminder uh of what you said earlier which is uh if you you focus on getting things done uh as opposed to just occupying an office or maintaining power then the satisfaction that you get uh is you know is unmatched uh and you know the good thing about Services is that uh anybody can do it uh if you're helping somebody else the satisfaction that you can get uh from that uh I think uh exceeds anything else that uh that you can do and uh that's usually what makes me inspired to do more uh and uh helps get through the the challenges and difficulties that uh we all have you know because obviously we're not the only people with uh bad days at work I think everybody knows knows what it's like to have a bad day at work you just have to keep on working through it uh eventually you'll make a difference G man for radio radial facebookl hash yes we can is hashtag eliminate poverty yes we can Quality Health Care to all yes

dWIGbpKqMY4,PM Modi's Radio Interaction with the Nation on 'Mann Ki Baat'| Mann ki Baat 3rd Episode,https://youtube.com/watch?v=dWIGbpKqMY4,2014-12-13,"[Music] My dear countrymen today I have got the privilege of meeting you again, you must think that why does the Prime Minister do such things, I do it because I am more prime minister, I am more prime servant, I have been listening to one thing since childhood and maybe the sameThe inspiration of the mind is that we have been hearing since childhood that it is less than sharing sorrow and it increases by sharing happiness, sometimes I share sorrows in the mind, sometimes I also share happiness in my mindThere is some pain by revealing it among you I lighten my mind and sometimes there are some things of happiness that I try to quadit that happiness by dividing it among you, I last said that I have been worried about our younger generation for a long time, soIt is not happening that you have made me Prime Minister, worrying is because the son or daughter of a mother gets caught in such a swamp, then the whole family is destroyed, the whole family is destroyed.Drug drug addiction is such a terrible disease. Those who shake the good good, when I used to work as Chief Minister in Gujarat, I used to come to get our good opportunities many times, I used to ask for holidays, I used to ask why I did not speak before but I usedWas that the son is trapped in bad things, I would have to leave all this and stay with him and I saw that those whom I used to consider very brave opportunities, they also remained only to cryHave you seen once I went to Punjab, there Mothers were found, I was also very angry, I was expressing a lot of pain, we have to worry about it as a society and I know that the child who gets caught in this evil, sometimes we convince that child to be a childThe reality is considered bad that the drug is bad, not bad, the child is not bad.If we give more intoxication, it will start getting intoxicated in itself And we have to treat it as psycho soasio medical problem and I have to handle in the same way that some problems are solved beyond the medical.It has to be done that the problem is not solved by doing this in pieces, I also had a conference of DGP in Assam, I expressed my pain in front of them with anger. I have asked to find a solution to make a serious debate in the police department.I The department has also asked the department that why should we start a toll free helpline so that in any corner of the country, the parents who are in trouble that they feel that they feel somewhere in the world of drugs, they are stuck in the world of drugs.It is ashamed to say where I have told the government to make a helpline, they will definitely think in that direction very soon and do something, in the same way I know the drugs bring three things and I will say it to himI am not a matter of entertainment I am a de ha is darkness, second de ha is a distraction and the third de Hai Divon Nasha takes it to the dark street.I have discussed the topic of concern when I touched this topic in the previous Mann Ki Baat program, more than 7000 letters in the country came to the AIR's address and asked for the letter in the government and asked for a separate online government portal.Thousands of emails came on D. in portal and maybe on Facebook Millions of comments have come, in a way, the matter lying in the mind of the society has started coming out together. I am especially thankful to the media of the country that they extended this, many TVs have done special programs for one hour and ISeeing that there was not only a program of the evils of the government in it, there was a concern and I believe that in a way there was a struggle to get out of the problem and due to this, the atmosphere of good discussion has started, the responsibility of the government has also been sensitive.They also feel that it is no longer indifferent I can sometimes want to ask those young men who have been drunk, have you ever thought that you might realize that you will feel free from troubles in two hours and four hours of drug addiction, but will you feel freedom from troubles butYou have ever thought that the money you buy with the money you go to the money, you have ever imagined, if you go to the terrorists, if the terrorists would have bought arms with the same money and with the same weapons, some terrorist is my country.In the chest of the young man The soldier of my country would have been martyred, so have you ever thought that you have shot a mother of a mother who killed a mother, who has been shot in the chest of a soldier who lives for a dear country, is there or not.Somewhere in that bullet, there is money for your addiction, think once and when you think about this, I also say that you also love Bharat Mata, you also respect the soldiers of the country, then youThis business that helped drug mafia helping terrorists How can some people feel that some people feel that when there is disappointment in life, failure comes, then there is no way in life, then a man climbs into drug addiction.No goal is not the goal is not high intentions. There is a vacuum. It becomes easy to enter the drug there. If you want to avoid drug, then make them a drug, make them a blast, make it a dream with the intention of doing somethingI will not feel like other things, he will not feel You must have seen the player who is a player in the cold and makes everyone sleep with a quilt, but he does not sleep, he goes away in the open ground at 4:00 am, why the dhcha is fixed.In this way, if you do not have a drunken Badita in any child, then it becomes a way for the entry of such evils.-The lukewarm Swami Vivekananda ji has said that take an idea, take that idea your life Make a forest, think about it. Dream it, take that idea in life.And that's why I will tell the youths that many things can be avoided only by becoming a blast, sometimes man lives among friends, it seems that this is a big cool, some people feel that this is a style statement and this is the same onepThe mind is not trapped in such a serious illness while not knowing in the ship itself. Do not let it be a style statement, it is cool.Dare Dare to reject, not only that, you are also doing it wrong, you are committing unfair, you should express the courage to say, I want to say to the mother and father, we do not have time nowadays, there is no time runningRun has to run to make your life better It is getting to be found, but in the middle of this race, we have time for our children, do we ever see that we mostly discuss our children's progress, how many marks brought how the exam has gone,Eat or where to go where to go, where to go, the scope of our things is so limited, have we ever given an opportunity to go inside his heart and give you an opportunity to open our children, you must do this if the children open with youThe bad habit in the child will be known suddenly It does not come slowly starts and as the evil starts, then its change also starts, that change should be seen closely, if you look closely at that change, then I am confident that you are absolutely in the sameYou will save your child, keep information about his friends and only do not limit things around progressChildren will have to save I understand what May parents do and no one else can do our ancestors here for centuries, their ancestors have said a lot of scholarship and only then they are called Statesman.Take love, Das Love Tadan Dei Sut only in 16 years, friend, Saris Gani Dei Sut, in 16 years, it means to say that the child should be treated with love and affection by the age of the child, after the age of the child, after the son 10.If you are of year, then discipline should be disciplined for it There should be an urge and sometimes we have seen that the sensible mother who is angry does not talk to the child. It is a big punishment for the child, the mother gives the money to herself, but the child is also punished.Just give me today, I will not speak, you see that the 10 -year -old child gets upset throughout the day, he changes his habit and when he is 16 years old, he should be treated like a friend, it should be openly talking about it.It has been told a good thing, I want how to do it in our family life Use, I am seeing one thing, sometimes with medicines, such things come with medicines, until such medicines are given without the prescription of the doctor, sometimes even then Kapha Sirf also gives a habit of drugs.The beginning becomes the beginning of the habit of drug, there are many things, I do not want to discuss it, but this discipline will also have to accept it.I live in a hostel winning life life for It is heard that he sometimes becomes an entry of this evil, educational institutions, the society has made great awareness that the responsibility will be effort to fulfill the responsibility of the government.It will be there and our effort should be made for this, I also want that I have come to the very interesting person, it is also a very painful chitiya.Went to jail and went to jail There were many wealth, but later there was a change in life, he studied in jail and gradually his life changed. His story is very popular.We can and should also come for that, our effort should also be for that, in the coming days, I will also urge celebrities, even if there are cine artists, people from the sports world are connected to public life.Wherever people get opportunities on this subject again and again You should keep awake, you should keep giving the message, there will be a benefit from which I urge those who are active in social media. We all can together run a frequent mats with drug free India hashtags because most of the children associated with this world socialIf we are also connected to the media, if we pursue drug free India hashtags, then we can create a good environment of public education. I want us to take this matter further, we should make some efforts that have achieved success.He kept sharing it but I I have touched this subject because I said, I said, I do not share sorrow, it is less than the pain of the country, I am not giving preaching and I am only giving preaching, I am only sharing my grief or either families in which this sorrowIt is in that grief I want to attend and I want to create an atmosphere of responsibility, maybe there may be opinion in this matter, but I have to start from somewhere, I said that I also want to share happiness, I want to share me blind last weekGot a chance to meet the cricket team after winning the World Cup A was A but I saw the enthusiasm that I saw the enthusiasm, the confidence that God has given us eyes, we have given our hands and feet everything, but perhaps we do not have such a passion which I saw in those blind cricketers, what was the excitement i.e. what was the excitement i.e.I also got energy together.I am not seeing this I have been watching the incident in another form for a long time, all the grounds were filled with water due to the weight in Kashmir, we know that even in the midstIt has been conquered that it is unprecedented and therefore difficulties are adverse circumstances, despite the crisis, how can the target be achieved, it has been shown by the youth of Jammu and Kashmir, so I had a special pleasure to hear this and I was proud and I amCongratulations to all the players Two days ago, the United Nation accepted Yoga as the whole world on 21 June.It was beneficial in a person's life, but yoga also showed that it can cause the world to connect the whole world on the issue of yoga and I am seeing that the proposal was unanimously passed two days ago and 177Nelson Mandla in the ghost of 177 countries It was decided to celebrate the birthday of Zee, when 165 countries were made spans, before that there was an attempt for the International Toilet, then 122 Country was sponsored, before that on October 2, 140 Country was made for Non Violence Day on 2 October.In the proposal 177 Country has become a world record i.e. I am grateful to all the countries of the world who respected India's spirit and decided to celebrate World Yoga Day, we all become responsible that the right sense of yoga is to the people.Arrived me last week The opportunity to meet the ministers had got an opportunity to meet the Chief Ministers, it has been happening for 50 years for 60 years, but this time I started meeting at the Prime Minister's residence and more than that we started a retreat program in which someone in handPaper is not a pen, but no officer, there is no file, all the Chief Ministers and the Prime Minister, for two and a half hours sitting as equal friends, talk in a light environment very seriously on different subjects of the country of the society in a light environmentOpen and talk Somewhere there was no shadow of politics on it. For me this was a very enjoyable feeling, I also want to share it among you, last week I got an opportunity to go to Northeast, I stayed there for three days, I have special urges to the youth of the country that if youI feel like watching the Tajmhal, if you feel like seeing Singapore, you ever like to see Dubai, I say, friends, you have to see nature, you have to see the natural form of God, then you must go to North East, I used to go to North East but I used to go beforeWhen I went there Trying to identify the power of the power of the possibilities of immense powers, our North East is such a dear people.

g2bNCHFcSlE,PM Modi's Radio Interaction with the Nation on 'Mann Ki Baat' | Mann ki Baat 2nd Episode,https://youtube.com/watch?v=g2bNCHFcSlE,2014-11-01,"[Music] My dear countrymen, after about a month, I have come again today, there is a very long time. Many events happen in the country and the world. You all also celebrate the festival of Diwali with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.Those who continue to fill the excitement in life from time to time, be rich, be from the village, it is from the city, everyone has its own greatness in the life of everyone, after Diwali, today I am meeting you for the first time, you have many best wishes to you.The last time I had talked to me, a new A There is a new feeling that has been a new feeling.No people of our country are not like this.I have been that this young India is especially committed to do something, the opportunity is eager Searching and doing it in my own way, I last said that last time I buy at least one Khadi clothes. I did not ask anyone to become a Khadi holdSales increased at 125. In a way, more than 2 October Khadi was sold in a week from October 2 compared to the previous year, it means that I am many times ahead of what the people of the country think.Greetings, cleanliness can imagine that cleanliness is such a water There will be a lot of expectations and should be the form of movement and I can see a good result. Cleaning is now being seen in two parts, one is the old dirt which is the pile of dirt, the people sitting in the government machinery rule for himWhat measures will be done is a big challenge, but you cannot run responsibly, all governments will have to take steps for this responsibility because the public pressure is going to increase and the media is also playing a very good role in it but the second aspect is also playing in it.Who is very excited It is blissful and the common man who gives satisfaction to the mind is beginning to feel that let's not leave the first thing, we will not increase the new dirt, I will not increase the dirt.He sent a mail, he was going to his railway and said his own experience, he said, ""Sir, I used to go to the railway earlier also, this time, I went to the railway, but I see that every passenger in the railway keeps drinking in the railway, and while throwing the paper gardener, he said that he would throw someone.""Did not find this only There is dustbin in the compartment, do we put garbage in it and when they saw that there is no arrangement in the railway, then they themselves collected their garbage in the corner, they said that it was a very pleasant experience for me.I am thankful to Bharat ji that he gave me this information, but I see that the most effectiveness has been among small children. Hundreds of families discuss that if our child eats chocolate now, then I immediately picks up the paperJust saw someone on a social media Someone wrote that today my hero and today in my hero, he gave a picture of a child and said that the child himself is a garbage anywhere anywhere, if he goes to school, he picks up himselfIt is being seen that everyone has started feeling that our country will not dirty, we will not increase the dirt and whoever does and feels ashamed, immediately someone gets to interrupt them, I consider it a good signIt is also happening that these days people who come to meet me all the days of society People of the region meet, government officials should be the people of the game of the game, the people of the senior world should be the people of the business world, whenever they talk to me these days, then in 10 minutes, four five minutes in the matter of 10 minutes, then those topics related to societyOn discussion, someone talks about cleanliness, someone talks about education.After the government, it will talk about its selfishness but a big change I am watching and talk about my selfishness, less about taking some responsibility related to the society, these are things that when I look at it, I know that in the direction of a very good changeWe are moving forward and this is right, the disease comes from dirt, but where does the disease come in the house of the rich, does the disease first knock at the poor's house, if we do cleanliness or the biggest of the poorHelp the work if any of my poor families will not be ill Economic crisis will never come in his life, he will be healthy, he will work hard and hence the family will run the direct relationship with the health of my poor siblings, we can do more service to the poor or not, we do not do the dirt or not.Even then it is good for the poor, it will be good in this form, it will be good for me to know many types of cheese, but I had said the last time that our special abbal child is God, God has given some shortage to GodIf you have given physical damage, then I am my I have also seen the feelings in front of everyone, I have seen that those who are working in this field are sending the stories of their success to me, but I came to know from my government, after my saying, our HRD ministryHe is the officer of that he felt that we should also do something and the officers together make a plan, see how the change in the government is an example, he decided that the special abbal child is a child if he wants to go into technical education, then he wants to go into technical educationHe has 1000 good special about such By liking that he has planned to give him a special scholarship.It is necessary for separate infrastructure that they do not climb on the CD, then for them, a separate system of tri -cycling needs a separate type of toilet, so all the officials of our HRD ministry have decided that One lakh rupees will be given in the Central School and Central University, every one and in one lakh forms and for these Special Abable Child who will have to create the necessary infrastructure, we will stand it.When the country was celebrating Diwali, I had gone to Siachen because we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them, in how many difficulties that he lived life, I experienced that I have experienced that I used to sleep the soldiers who protected the country.I am but today me Another proud thing is to say that the soldiers of our country work in the field of security, no one is willing to dare to protect us by putting life in the way of natural disaster, the soldiers of our country in sports also in sportsYou keep on raising the pride of India.Especially Abhi to these soldiers Nandan, I just got an opportunity, I had a tea paan program from the winner of the young men of our country who came in sports, I got a new energy from the winner, I got a new energy and I was seeing that more countries that more countriesCompared to our arrangements are very low, but instead of complaint, I was talking about doing something more with enthusiasm and enthusiasm, my program of tea with these players in myself was my very inspiration to me, I was very inspiring me.It was a matter of one thing and in the country I want to say to Sia and I am true, my mind is a matter of mind and I believe the countrymen trust my words, but today I want to repeat it on my behalf once again as far as the question of black moneyIt is a question of black money. My countrymen should trust your chief servant.There may be differences and natural in democracy but Ray countrymen, based on what I understand and on the basis of the information I have, I assure you that we are on the right path today, no one knows nor do I know nor do you know the government nor do you knowAlso knew how much money is out, everyone keeps telling different figures in their own way, I do not want to get entangled in those figures.This is the money of the poor of the country, should come back and I assure you There will be no shortage in my efforts, no one will be taken care of, I just keep your blessings, whatever I have to do for you, I will keep on doing this, I will keep you trusting you, I have come to a letter from Mr. Abhishek ParikBy the way, this kind of feeling was not the Prime Minister of me, even then many mothers and sisters had revealed that some doctors, friends, had also revealed to me and I too have been revealing my feelings on this subject in the past, Mr. Abhishek ParikHas told me that Consumption of drug addiction in the younger generation is increasing towards drugs. They have told me that you must discuss this and your mind, I agree with their suffering, I will definitely talk about the next mind when I will definitely talk about the next mindThis intoxication of this drug this drugs or drugs mafia and the young wealth of India can cause a big crisis, I will definitely discuss it in the next time, you have some experience in that subject, you have some information, if you have saved the children with this drug addicts if you have saved the children.There are some ways to save some ways to save If you have played a good role, if you give such information to me, then I will come in front of the countrymen about these good efforts and we will all together create an atmosphere in every family that due to the first body, no child will definitely go on this pathWe will discuss in detail.So there is a crisis for good intentions I will also dare to this due to your love due to your blessings and I will keep doing this, some people also told me that Modi ji, you give suggestions, give our suggestions on Facebook.If you listen to the matter, then you will also send a letter to the Akashvani Parliament, New Delhi, even if you will send a letter and give some suggestions, he will definitely reach me and I will definitely take it seriously because the biggest capital of active civil development is you, you write a letter.Are you very active that you are very active Remember that you means that you are a concen from the subjects of the country and this is the strength of the country, I invite you to your mind, your mind should also be connected.Then next month I will try to talk to you, whenever I talk, I will do it at 11 o'clock on Sunday, now the weather is changing, the cold is slowly starting.Great good clothes for some people The weather is for wearing the area, but along with it, it is also a very good weather for health, do not know it, use it very much thank you very much thank you very much."
-FuVIwO2PwQ,PM Modi's first address to the Nation on Radio - 'Mann Ki Baat' | Mann ki Baat 1st Episode,https://youtube.com/watch?v=-FuVIwO2PwQ,2014-10-03,"[Music] My dear countrymen today is the auspicious festival of Vijaya Dashami, many wishes of Vijaya Dashami, I want to tell you some minds through radio today and it is in my mind that it is not just todayIf I keep going on the sequence, I will try, then either twice a month, take time out once a month and talk to you and later I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and time will be Sunday and the time at 11 am in the morningIf you are of, then you will also be facing and I will also be satisfied I have been successful in bringing my mind to your mind, today when Vijaya celebrates the festival of Dashami, the festival of Vijaya Dashami is a festival of victory of good over evils, but a Mr. Ganesh Wakra Dari of Mumbai, he sent a mail to me, he said that he said that he said thatIn Vijaya Dashami, we should resolve to end the 10 evils within us. I thank them for this suggestion, everyone must think that by defeating the more evils of their own blessings, but as a nation, but as a nationI think come and On the holy festival of Jaja Dashami, we all resolve to get rid of dirty and to conquer the dirt and get victory on the festival of Vija Dashami, we can resolve this, tomorrow October 2 is a campaign of Swachh Bharat on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.C crore countrymen started.You will also invite people Clear, do you clean your nine people whom you want to offer.The atmosphere will be created.There cannot be a manure in it Am I not asking you to become a Khadi holdMay be a bedsheet, there is a curtain of the pillow, even if there is a fond of every type of fabric in the family, then there should be a fond of every typeIf you buy clothes, then the lamp of Diwali burns in a poor house and hence the same thing and these days If you have a special discount in the market of Khadi from October 2 to about a month, you can also take advantage of it, do a small thing and insist it.When I say, what has been done so far, we feel that the government will do everything and where we have left, if we have to move forward, then we will have to recognize ourselves, we have to know our power.And I tell the truth that we are in the world You know you know that our scientists have successfully overcome the successful use of reaching Mars at least. Our strength is not lacking, only we have forgotten our power, we have forgotten ourselves.Dear brothers and sisters, it could not be like this, Swami Vivekananda often used to tell one thing always, perhaps he must have heard this to people many times, Vivekananda used to say that once a lioness was going away through the path of her two small children.When he saw a flock of sheep When I felt like hunting, the lioness ran towards that side and one of his children also started running with him, but the other child went backwards and went ahead while hunting the sheep, but a child went ahead but a child was separated in the child who got separated in the child who got separatedA mother sheep raised her up and that lion started growing up behind the sheep, her colloquial habits became like the sheep, her laughing is to sit down, all of them became with the sheep.
